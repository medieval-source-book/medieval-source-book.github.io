<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>This story is one of five in the <i> Global Medieval Sourcebook </i> to have been selected from the <i> Yijian Zhi </i> (or, <i> Record of the Listener</i> , hereafter the <i> Record</i> ) by Hong Mai (1123-1202). Like many well-educated men in the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), Hong Mai grew up in a prominent family, passed the civil service examination, and obtained a post in the imperial government. However, due to misconduct during a diplomatic mission, his career came to an abrupt end. From then on, he retreated to his study and devoted himself to writing the <i> Record</i> .</p>

<p>The corpus of the <i> Record </i> originally consisted of 420 chapters. What we have today, however, is but a small fraction of the original text. The <i> Record </i> shows a remarkable degree of accuracy when we compare it with the official documents and other texts of the same period. Nevertheless, many stories in the <i> Record </i> are outright fictitious or based on highly unreliable sources. The <i> Record </i> preserved much information about the society, culture, and religion of the Southern Song Dynasty and was a source of inspiration for generations of writers after Hong Mai. Writers in late imperial China, for instance, took up many stories in the <i> Record </i> and refashioned them into stories that met the demands and expectations of their own times.</p>

<p>金國天會十四年四月中, 京小雨, 大雷震, 群犬數十爭赴土河而死, 所可救者才一二耳。</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of the Tianhui era of the State of Jin, it was raining in the capital. There occurred a huge thunderbolt. Several dozen dogs ran in a group into the Tu River and died. Only one or two were rescued and survived.</p>
