<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>This poem is a <i> serranilla</i> , an evolution of the Provençal <i> pastorela</i> . Written in short verse (<i> arte menor</i> ), <i> serranillas </i> narrate a courtly poet’s encounter with a mountain woman. This is one of six compositions in the genre by fifteenth-century author Carvajal (or Carvajales). Very little is known about Carvajal’s life. His poetry is linked to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples (r. 1442-1458) and to that of Alfonso’s son Ferrante (r. 1459-1494). In addition to his famous <i> serranillas</i> , Carvajal is also known for his literary epistles and ballads.</p>

<p>In this poem, Carvajal subverts some of the genre’s conventions, as he does not meet a <i> serrana </i> but a lady of the court—the Princess of Rossano—in the context in which he would have normally run into a rustic woman. Upon encountering the lady, the poet ponders her beauty with references to biblical and mythological characters.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Source</h2>
<p>The poem is copied in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España, VITR/17/7, fol. 136v-137r. This manuscript is a copy of the poetry collection known as the <i> Cancionero de Estúñiga</i> <a href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/view-" target="_blank"> , ca. 1465. It has been digitized: </a> http://bdh-rd.bne.es/view- er.vm?id=0000051837. It contains a compilation of mostly Castilian poems, including ballads, as well as a few Italian compositions. Their authors accompanied the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous, in Naples in the mid-fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Entre Sesa et Cintura caçando por la trauiesa, tope dama que dehesa parescia en su fermosura.</p>

<p>Pense que fuese Diana que caçasse las siluestras, o aquella que lla<em>1</em> mançana</p>
<p>gano a las biuas muestras.<em>2</em> “Soys humana criatura?” dixe, et dixo, non con priessa, “Si sennor, et principessa</p>
<p>de Rosano por uentura”.</p>

<p>O, flor de toda bellesa, o, templo de honestidat, palacio de gentilesa, fundamiento de bondat,</p>
<p>mi sententia uos condena;</p>
<p>que si en aquel templo de Baris uos fallara l’ynfante Paris,</p>
<p>non fuera robada Elena.</p>

<p>Nin de Bersabe, Dauid non se dexara vençer, nin Usrias tornara en lid por sus dias fenescer;</p>
<p>tanto soys de gracia llena que si iuntas uos mirara, muy menos se enamorara Archiles de Poliçena.</p>
<p>Between Sessa and Cintura</p>
<p>While hunting across the countryside, I came upon a lady who like a goddess Looked; such was her beauty.</p>

<p>5 I thought she was Diana, Hunting wild beasts,</p>
<p>Or her who the apple Demonstrably won.</p>
<p>“Are you a human creature?”</p>
<p>10 I said, and she said with no hurry, “Yes sir, and the Princess</p>
<p>Of Rossano by good fortune.”</p>

<p>Oh, flower of extreme beauty, Oh, temple of honesty,</p>
<p>15 Palace of courtesy, Foundation of goodness,</p>
<p>My sentence condemns you;</p>
<p>If you had been in that temple of Bari And had met Prince Paris,</p>
<p>20 Helen would not have been stolen away.</p>

<p>Neither by Bathsheba, David Would have been conquered,</p>
<p>Nor Uriah would have returned to the battle To end his days;</p>
<p>25 For you are so full of grace</p>
<p>That had [Achilles] seen the two of you next to each other,</p>
<p>He would have never fallen in love with Polyxena.</p>
