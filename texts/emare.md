<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>Emaré is a 14th-century Middle English adaptation of a narrative type known as “maiden-without-hands” (AT 706), “Manekine-story,” or “Constance-saga”. It follows the misadventures of a female protagonist whom most versions characterize as royal, pious, educated, and beautiful. Refusing her father’s incestuous advances, she flees or is exiled. In exile, the local ruler wishes to marry her; many versions emphasize her otherworldly beauty. A relative or courtier does not trust the beautiful stranger. When her husband is absent for the birth of their child, the mistrustful relative or courtier intercepts a letter (or series of letters) delivering the news and replaces them with slanderous content, resulting in a second exile. Ultimately, the family reunites, in most versions in Rome, where the protagonist’s husband and father seek absolution for their sins and find the protagonist and her child (or children).</p>

<p>The oldest known versions of this narrative date to the 13th century (<em>Vitae Offarum Duorum</em>, insular Latin, 1250 or earlier; <em>Mai und Beaflor</em>, German, dated variously from 1220–80; <em>La Manekine</em>, French, dated variously from 1230–80), but it has been retold over centuries across languages, genre, and faith communities. Its origins and the connections between different versions cannot be established. In the (Latin) West, Maryvonne Hagby counts 41 distinct versions in medieval English, German, Latin and Romance languages (including Catalan, Spanish, French, and Italian), with manuscripts spanning from insular Britain across the European Continent to North Africa, as stand-alone romances, novellas, exempla, miracle tales, or plays, or as chronicle or romance subplots. The <em>Global Medieval Sourcebook</em> contains an Aragonese version of the story found in a 16th-century Aljamiado manuscript: http://sourcebook.stanford.edu/text/damsel_carcayciona. <em>Emaré</em> adapts the tale as a short, tail-rhymed narrative which identifies itself as a Breton Lay (see l. 1030). It thus associates itself with a “Celtic” or Breton story matter, to which it establishes further links by way of Arthurian character names.</p>

<p>A prevalent stylistic feature of this text is its use of repetition. Another noteworthy feature is its long ekphrasis (description) of a wondrous cloth which the Sicilian King Tergaunte brings to the protagonist’s father, the Emperor Artyus. While Artyus is blinded by the rich, gem-encrusted textile, the description makes visible the embroidery and provides a biography of the object. The narrator tells us that it was worked with rare materials by the Emir of Babylon’s daughter as a love-token for the Sultan of Babylon’s son. Four panels in the cloth depict romance couples: Amadas and Ydoine, Tristan and Yseut, Floire and Blancheflur, and the Babylonian lovers themselves. It comes to Tergaunte as a spoil of war. After Tergaunte’s departure, the Emperor desires his daughter and has a wedding dress shaped from the cloth; he exiles her while she is still wearing the dress. Emaré and her son Segramour are frequently referred to as being “worthy beneath their clothing.” Narrative attention is directed to her dazzling robe at all major plot points.</p>

<p>Scholarly discussion to date has often focused on the ekphrasis of the wondrous cloth, including its connection with genre, incest, the narrative’s relation to the organizing principles of Cotton Caligula Aii (the miscellany in which it was transmitted), its poetics, and its negotiation of interfaith relations. However, the text is barely acknowledged outside of English Studies and is usually aligned with more famous versions, such as Chaucer’s “Man of Law’s Tale”, Gower’s <em>Confessio Amantis</em>, or <em>La Manekine</em>. Fruitful comparisons could be made with less acclaimed versions and, more generally, <em>Emaré</em> could be studied from the perspective of its position within a transcultural textual network transcending modern notions of separated national literatures.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Source</h2>
<p>The 15th-century miscellany British Library Cotton Caligula Aii contains the only extant copy of the text. While tentatively dated to the second half of the 14th century, <em>Emaré</em> is likely based on a lost 13th-century French text which Edith Rickert, a previous editor of the text, has linked to the crusading milieu. The miscellany includes one epic and seven romance texts alongside devotional and didactic material. While the other romances are grouped together, <em>Emaré</em> is inserted in the middle of a series of devotional texts. Opening with a prayer to “Jhesu that is kyng in trone” (l. 1), <em>Emaré</em> ’s prologue appears to continue the frequent invocations of Jesus found in the prayer which precedes it (“Jesus for your Blood”). According to Rickert, <em>Emaré</em> contains the longest introductory prayer of any Middle English romance. This is an indication of the narrative’s links to religious modes of writing and to the manuscript’s didactic and devotional contents.</p>

<h2>About this Edition</h2>
<p>This text is based on Ritson’s 1885 edition. It reproduces Ritson’s normalization of the MS’s Thorn and Yogh to ‘th’ and ‘gh’ and his stanzaic typesetting. Changes to his text are italicized. It has been read carefully against Rickert’s critical edition, Laskaya and Salisbury’s more recent edition, and Denise C. White’s diplomatic transcription, since Ritson does not reliably flag emendations. Gough’s critical edition interferes with the manuscript’s text much more aggressively than Rickert’s and is thus considered only cursorily. Variance across editions concerns the extent of normalization, punctuation, and typesetting; and has been commented on where it affects meaning. It has not been possible to hold editorial variances against the manuscript itself.</p>

<p>Emaré, particularly the ekphrastic passage, is riddled with ambiguities, which are discussed in the notes. The punctuation of the translation punctuation differs from that of the edited Middle English text. I would like to thank Caitlin Flynn and Jan-Peer Hartmann for their advice on translation issues and Alina Karsten for her help in preparing the transcription.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>325 Now this lady dwelled thore</p>

<p>She was on the see so harde bestadde,</p>
<p>335 For hunger and thurste almost madde,</p>
<p>Woo worth wederus yll!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>She was dryven into a lond,</p>
<p>That hyghth Galys, y untherstond,</p>
<p>That was a fayr cuntre,</p>
<p>340 The kynges steward dwelled ther bysyde,</p>

<p>Every day wolde he go,</p>

<p>On a tyme he toke the eyr,</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>925 The kyng yn herte was full woo,</p>
<p>When he herd mynge tho</p>
<p>Of her that was his qwene;</p>
<p>And sayde, Sone, why sayest thou so?</p>

<p>He toke her yn his armes two,</p>
<p>935 For joy they sowened both to,</p>
<p>Such love was hem bytwene.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>A joyfull metyng was ther thore,</p>
<p>Of that lady goodly unther-gore,</p>
<p>Frely in armes to folde;</p>
<p>940 Lorde! gladde was syr Kadore,</p>

<p>Leve we at the lady whyte as flour,</p>
<p>And speke we of her fadur the emperour,</p>
<p>That fyrste the tale of ytolde,</p>

<p>Messengeres he sente forth sone,</p>
<p>And they come to the kowrt of Rome,</p>
<p>960 To take her lordes inne.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Emare prayde her lorde the kyng,</p>
<p>Syr, abyde that lordys komyng,</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Emare thawghte her sone yynge,</p>

<p>Swete sone, yn all thyng,</p>

<p>The chyld was worthy unther-wede,</p>

<h2> Emare </h2>
<p>Jesus, who is king on the throne,</p>
<p>as You shaped both the sun and the moon</p>
<p>and all that will judge and govern,</p>
<p>bestow upon us grace to do such deeds</p>
<p>5 that we may dwell in Your exultation.</p>
<p>People call it the heavenly light.</p>
<p>And Your mother, Mary, heavenly Queen,</p>
<p>intercede on our behalf—</p>
<p>[Mary], who is beautiful to look at—</p>
<p>10 with Your Son, who is so noble,</p>
<p>so that we may be with Him in Heaven.</p>
<p>That Lord is the most powerful.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Entertainers who walk far and wide,</p>
<p>here and there, everywhere,</p>
<p>15 in many a different country,</p>
<p>should [first], when they start,</p>
<p>speak of that righteous King</p>
<p>who made both the sea and the sand.</p>
<p>Whoever would like to stop and linger:</p>
<p>20 I will tell you of much joy,</p>
<p>interspersed with sorrow,</p>
<p>of a fair and noble lady.</p>
<p>Her name was Emaré,</p>
<p>as I am singing here in song.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>25 Her father was an emperor</p>
<p>overseeing castles and splendid strongholds,</p>
<p>Sir Artyus was his name.</p>
<p>He had halls as well as bowers,</p>
<p>considerable hunting grounds, forests with flowers;</p>
<p>30 there was no lord as noble as him.</p>
<p>He had married a lady</p>
<p>who was both fair and beautiful,</p>
<p>white as whalebone:</p>
<p>Dame Erayne that empress was called.</p>
<p>35 She was full of love and virtue,</p>
<p>no lady was as courteous.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Of all men that were alive then</p>
<p>Sir Artyus was the most excellent.</p>
<p>[He was] both valiant and brave.</p>
<p>40 He was courteous in every respect,</p>
<p>both to the old and to the young,</p>
<p>and he was able to judge and govern well.</p>
<p>He had but one child in his life,</p>
<p>conceived with his wedded wife,</p>
<p>45 and [the child] was fair and radiant.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I can tell you,</p>
<p>they called that child Emaré</p>
<p>who was beautiful to look at.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When she was delivered from her mother,</p>
<p>50 she was the fairest creature born</p>
<p>[and alive] in that country.</p>
<p>Then the empress, that fair lady,</p>
<p>was parted from her lord by death</p>
<p>before she [Emaré] could walk or talk.</p>
<p>55 The child, who was beautiful and noble,</p>
<p>was sent to a lady</p>
<p>who was called Abro.</p>
<p>She taught her courtly manners and good conduct,</p>
<p>how to embroider with golden and silken threads,</p>
<p>60 alongside other young girls.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Abro taught this small maiden</p>
<p>the correct manners to be used in the dining hall,</p>
<p>while she was staying in her quarters.</p>
<p>She was courteous in every respect,</p>
<p>65 both to the old and to the young,</p>
<p>and [she was] as white as a lily-flower.</p>
<p>She was skillful with her hands.</p>
<p>All who saw her loved her</p>
<p>with honor and much respect.</p>
<p>70 Here we shall leave the maiden</p>
<p>and the fair and noble lady,</p>
<p>and speak of the emperor.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The high-born emperor</p>
<p>was a courteous and just lord</p>
<p>75 in every respect.</p>
<p>Later, when his wife had died,</p>
<p>and he led his life as a widower,</p>
<p>he much liked to keep himself amused.</p>
<p>Some time later,</p>
<p>80 the powerful king of Sicily</p>
<p>made his way to the emperor.</p>
<p>He brought a costly gift with him,</p>
<p>a fabric that was made skillfully.</p>
<p>He [the emperor] received him in a courtly manner.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>85 Sir Tergaunte was the name of that noble knight.</p>
<p>He offered a gift to the emperor in a courtly manner,</p>
<p>having bent down on his knee:</p>
<p>a cloth that was richly ornamented.</p>
<p>It was bejeweled over and over with stones,</p>
<p>90 as densely as possible,</p>
<p>with topazes and rubies</p>
<p>and other stones of great worth</p>
<p>that were beautiful to look at,</p>
<p>with toadstones and nakettes.</p>
<p>95 They are set so thickly,</p>
<p>truthfully, as I am telling you.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The fabric was displayed quickly.</p>
<p>The emperor gazed upon it</p>
<p>and was not able to identify anything on it</p>
<p>100 —because of the glistening of the precious stones—</p>
<p>he did not have ready sight of it,</p>
<p>and [he] said, “How is this possible?”</p>
<p>The emperor hastily said,</p>
<p>“Certainly, this is fairywork,</p>
<p>105 Or else an illusion!”</p>
<p>Then the King of Sicily answered,</p>
<p>“There is no [other] jewel as precious</p>
<p>in all of Christendom.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The daughter of the Muslim emir</p>
<p>made this cloth, certainly,</p>
<p>and wrought it entirely and honorably</p>
<p>and fashioned it with great virtues,</p>
<p>with precious gold and azure,</p>
<p>and [with] stones on every side.</p>
<p>115 And, as the story at hand tells,</p>
<p>the stones that are positioned in this cloth</p>
<p>were sought from very far away.</p>
<p>It was in the making for seven years</p>
<p>before it was completed,</p>
<p>120 that is the truth of it.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>In that one corner</p>
<p>Ydoine and Amadas were made</p>
<p>with love that was so steadfast;</p>
<p>because they loved each other honorably</p>
<p>125 they were portrayed with the true-love-flower</p>
<p>[made] of stones of radiant hues:</p>
<p>with carbuncle and sapphire,</p>
<p>chalcedony and onyx, gleaming so,</p>
<p>set in new gold;</p>
<p>130 diamonds and rubies</p>
<p>and other stones of great worth</p>
<p>and entertainers with their song.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>In that other corner were assembled</p>
<p>Tristan and Iseult, so radiant—</p>
<p>135 they were beautiful to look at;</p>
<p>and because they loved each other sincerely,</p>
<p>they are composed of so many stones,</p>
<p>[set] as thickly as possible,</p>
<p>[composed] of topazes and rubies,</p>
<p>140 and other stones of great worth,</p>
<p>that were beautiful to look at.</p>
<p>With toadstone and nakettes</p>
<p>they [Tristan and Iseult] are set thickly with stones,</p>
<p>truthfully, as I am telling you.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>145 In the third corner, with great splendor,</p>
<p>was Floris and Dame Blanchefleur,</p>
<p>because love was between them.</p>
<p>As they loved honorably</p>
<p>they were depicted with the true-love-flower,</p>
<p>150 with stones that were bright and luminous.</p>
<p>There were knights and senators,</p>
<p>emeralds of great virtues,</p>
<p>truthfully, no doubt,</p>
<p>diamonds and coral,</p>
<p>155 chrysolites and crystal,</p>
<p>and good garnets in between.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>In the fourth corner was</p>
<p>the Sultan of Babylon’s son,</p>
<p>the emir’s daughter by his side.</p>
<p>160 For his sake the cloth had been made.</p>
<p>She loved him in her heart and mind,</p>
<p>as this story testifies.</p>
<p>In front of the fair maiden</p>
<p>a unicorn was depicted</p>
<p>165 with his horn held up so high,</p>
<p>flowers and birds on each side,</p>
<p>with stones that were sought from far away,</p>
<p>endowed with [figural] decorations.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When the making of the cloth was finished,</p>
<p>170 it was brought to the sultan’s son,</p>
<p>so beautiful to look at.</p>
<p>“My father was a noble man;</p>
<p>he gained [the cloth] from the sultan</p>
<p>with violence and force.</p>
<p>175 Because of his love, he gave it to me.</p>
<p>I bring it to you on account ofspecial affection;</p>
<p>this cloth is put together magnificently.”</p>
<p>He gave it to the emperor.</p>
<p>He received it with great honor</p>
<p>180 and thanked him eloquently and appropriately.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The King of Sicily stayed there</p>
<p>as long as he wished</p>
<p>to amuse himself with the emperor;</p>
<p>and when he wanted to return home,</p>
<p>185 he took his leave immediately,</p>
<p>and went on his way.</p>
<p>Now this noble king had departed.</p>
<p>The emperor had a longing for his daughter,</p>
<p>[he desired] to speak with that maiden.</p>
<p>190 He sent messengers</p>
<p>to the beautiful and noble maiden</p>
<p>who was as radiant as a summer’s day.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Messengers hurriedly prepared themselves.</p>
<p>With much merriment and music,</p>
<p>195 they went forth,</p>
<p>by street and by path,</p>
<p>to that fair lady,</p>
<p>[who] was virtuous underneath her garments.</p>
<p>Her nurse, who was called Abro,</p>
<p>200 also went with her,</p>
<p>and they were seated in a carriage.</p>
<p>Then they went to the emperor,</p>
<p>who went a mile or two in their direction to meet them.</p>
<p>A pleasant meeting was held there.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>205 The maiden, white as a lily-flower,</p>
<p>alighted facing her father, the emperor;</p>
<p>two knights led her.</p>
<p>Her father, who was of great fame,</p>
<p>who wore the golden crown,</p>
<p>210 alighted from his steed.</p>
<p>When they were both on their feet,</p>
<p>he embraced her and sweetly kissed her,</p>
<p>and they both walked on foot.</p>
<p>They were joyous and made good cheer</p>
<p>215 and walked to the palace together,</p>
<p>as we read in romance.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Then the lords, who were distinguished,</p>
<p>washed [their hands] and sat down to eat,</p>
<p>and people served them swiftly.</p>
<p>220 The young woman, who was of a delightful shape,</p>
<p>sat down in front of her own father.</p>
<p>[She was] the most beautiful woman alive.</p>
<p>[So] all his heart and all his mind</p>
<p>was fixated on loving her.</p>
<p>225 He gazed at her often.</p>
<p>He was so enamored by his daughter</p>
<p>that he schemed how to have his way</p>
<p>and wed her as his wife.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>And when dinner was over</p>
<p>230 he soon went into his chamber</p>
<p>and called his council in.</p>
<p>He bade them to go and return quickly,</p>
<p>and get leave from the Pope of Rome</p>
<p>to wed that beautiful maiden.</p>
<p>235 The messengers went forth.</p>
<p>They did not dare to break his command;</p>
<p>and earls went with them, too.</p>
<p>They went to the court in Rome</p>
<p>and soon brought (back) the Pope’s dispensation</p>
<p>240 [for Artyus] to wed his dear daughter.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Then the emperor was joyous and happy,</p>
<p>and swiftly had a robe shaped</p>
<p>from the gold cloth.</p>
<p>And when it was put upon her</p>
<p>245 she did not seem like an earthly woman</p>
<p>who was created by God.</p>
<p>Then the very noble emperor said,</p>
<p>“Daughter, I want to wed you,</p>
<p>you are so bright to behold.”</p>
<p>250 Then that worthy one underneath the clothing said,</p>
<p>“No, Sir, God of Heaven forbids</p>
<p>that we should ever do so!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>“If it so happened that you married me</p>
<p>and we were to amuse ourselves in bed</p>
<p>255 we would both be lost!</p>
<p>The word would spread far and wide;</p>
<p>the news would be carried</p>
<p>into every corner of the world.</p>
<p>You are a lord of outstanding praise,</p>
<p>260 [so] Lord, never let such sorrow arise:</p>
<p>pay heed to God!</p>
<p>That my father should wed me,</p>
<p>God forbid that I should witness that,</p>
<p>(God) who was adorned with a crown of thorns!”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>265 The emperor was consumed with rage,</p>
<p>and swore many a great oath</p>
<p>that she must die.</p>
<p>He had a magnificent boat made</p>
<p>and put her inside, God knows,</p>
<p>270 in that robe of magnificent brightness.</p>
<p>She was not permitted to have any spendable wealth with her,</p>
<p>nor food, nor drink,</p>
<p>and he cast her into the sea.</p>
<p>Now the lady remained there for a long time</p>
<p>275 without anker or [steering] oar</p>
<p>and that was a great misery!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>There came a wind, I understand,</p>
<p>and [it] blew her boat away from the shore.</p>
<p>They lost sight of her.</p>
<p>280 The emperor thought to himself</p>
<p>that he had done a great wrong</p>
<p>and he was a sorry knight.</p>
<p>And as he stood in contemplation,</p>
<p>he fell down into a swoon,</p>
<p>285 he fell down onto the ground.</p>
<p>Great lords stood nearby</p>
<p>and hastily helped up the emperor</p>
<p>and comforted him kindly and well.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When he had regained consciousness</p>
<p>290 he wept sorely and said, “Alas,</p>
<p>for my dear daughter!</p>
<p>Alas, that I was born,</p>
<p>miserable wretch that I am!”</p>
<p>The tears ran down his face.</p>
<p>295 “I acted against God’s law</p>
<p>towards her, who was so true of faith,</p>
<p>alas, why is she not here!”</p>
<p>The tears flooded out of his eyes;</p>
<p>the high-ranked lords who witnessed this</p>
<p>300 wept and displayed their grief.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Nobody, neither old nor young</p>
<p>could abstain from weeping</p>
<p>for that beautiful one under the cloak.</p>
<p>They quickly rushed onto ships</p>
<p>305 in order to seek the young maiden</p>
<p>who was so fair of flesh and skin.</p>
<p>They searched for her all over the sea</p>
<p>and could not find that noble lady.</p>
<p>Quickly they came back.</p>
<p>310 We now leave the emperor,</p>
<p>and I shall begin to speak</p>
<p>of the lady at sea.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The lady drifted forth alone;</p>
<p>to God in Heaven she made her complaint</p>
<p>and also to His mother.</p>
<p>She was propelled by the wind and the rain</p>
<p>and opposed by the dark water’s</p>
<p>fierce storms.</p>
<p>As I have heard storytellers sing and tell</p>
<p>320 she could neither see settlements nor land;</p>
<p>she was afraid to move.</p>
<p>She was tossed from wave to wave.</p>
<p>She hid her head and lay low.</p>
<p>The water tormented her.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>325 Now this lady remained there</p>
<p>for a good seven nights and longer</p>
<p>—as it was God’s will—</p>
<p>with a heavy heart and sighing loudly;</p>
<p>this misfortune was her destiny</p>
<p>330 and she always lay still.</p>
<p>She was driven to a land</p>
<p>through the grace of God’s mercy</p>
<p>which encompasses all things.</p>
<p>She had been harassed so severely at sea</p>
<p>335 that she was almost crazed from hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>Cursed be ill weather!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>She was driven into a land</p>
<p>that was called “Galys,” as I understand,</p>
<p>which was a pleasant country.</p>
<p>340 The king’s steward dwelled there beside [the sea]</p>
<p>in a castle of great worth;</p>
<p>he was called Sir Kadore.</p>
<p>Every day he would go</p>
<p>and take a squire or two with him</p>
<p>345 and they would amuse themselves on the beach.</p>
<p>On one of these occasions he went outside for a walk</p>
<p>with two good and fair knights;</p>
<p>the weather was pleasant and calm.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>He found a boat by the sea</p>
<p>350 and a glistening thing inside it</p>
<p>which made them marvel.</p>
<p>They went across the sand</p>
<p>to the boat, as I understand,</p>
<p>and found that lady inside.</p>
<p>355 She had been without food for so long</p>
<p>that it grieved them greatly to see</p>
<p>[that] she was on the point of dying.</p>
<p>They asked her what her name was:</p>
<p>she changed it there on the spot</p>
<p>360 and said she was called Egaré.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Sir Kadore felt great compassion:</p>
<p>he picked up the lady of the sea</p>
<p>and led her home.</p>
<p>She had been without food for so long</p>
<p>365 that she had grown as lean as a tree,</p>
<p>that worthy one underneath the dress.</p>
<p>When she came into his castle,</p>
<p>they took her into a chamber</p>
<p>and fed her well</p>
<p>370 with all the delicious food and drink</p>
<p>they could think of</p>
<p>that was in the castle.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When that fair-faced lady</p>
<p>was restored with food and drink</p>
<p>375 and had regained her [healthy] complexion,</p>
<p>she taught them how to sew and embroider</p>
<p>all kinds of silk work;</p>
<p>they were very pleased with her.</p>
<p>She was courteous in every respect,</p>
<p>380 both to the old and the young,</p>
<p>I tell you, truthfully.</p>
<p>She was able to fashion all sorts of things</p>
<p>that would befit an emperor or a king,</p>
<p>earl, baron, or retainer.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>385 Sir Kadore arranged for a feast</p>
<p>that was proper and appropriate</p>
<p>for his lord, the king.</p>
<p>There was much entertainment,</p>
<p>trumpets, tambourines, and zithers,</p>
<p>390 harps, as well as fiddle-playing.</p>
<p>The lady who was noble and [yet] lowly,</p>
<p>served in the hall in just her frock</p>
<p>before that noble king.</p>
<p>The cloth upon her shone so intensely</p>
<p>395 when she was in dressed in it</p>
<p>that she did not seem to be an earthly thing.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The king gazed at her.</p>
<p>He had never seen such a beautiful lady before.</p>
<p>She held his heart in her grasp.</p>
<p>400 He was so enamored of that sight</p>
<p>that he was unable to eat</p>
<p>but quickly fixed his gaze upon her.</p>
<p>She was so beautiful and noble</p>
<p>that the king’s love was bestowed on her</p>
<p>405 as it is told in the tale.</p>
<p>And when the dinner was over</p>
<p>he went quickly into his chamber</p>
<p>and confidently called his barons.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>First he called Sir Kadore,</p>
<p>410 and other knights that were present,</p>
<p>to come to him quickly.</p>
<p>Well-educated dukes and earls</p>
<p>hastily came before the king</p>
<p>and asked him what he required.</p>
<p>415 Then the powerful sovereign spoke.</p>
<p>He started uttering</p>
<p>affectionate and secret words to Sir Kadore:</p>
<p>“Sir, where is that lovely maiden from,</p>
<p>who was serving in the hall today?</p>
<p>420 Tell me if you may.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Then Sir Kadore said, as I understand,</p>
<p>“She is an earl’s daughter from a faraway land</p>
<p>who is beautiful to look at.</p>
<p>Truthfully I sent for her</p>
<p>425 to nurture my children,</p>
<p>and to keep them company in their chamber.</p>
<p>She is the most erudite woman,</p>
<p>for sure, in all of Christendom,</p>
<p>[judging by] the works I have seen.”</p>
<p>430 Then the powerful sovereign said,</p>
<p>“I will possess that fair maiden</p>
<p>and wed her as my queen.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The noble king, truthfully,</p>
<p>sent for his mother</p>
<p>435 to find out what she would say.</p>
<p>They hastily brought forth</p>
<p>that fair young woman Egaré;</p>
<p>she was as bright as a summer’s day.</p>
<p>The fabric on her gleamed so brightly</p>
<p>440 when she was dressed in it,</p>
<p>and [she was] herself a noble maiden.</p>
<p>The old queen immediately said,</p>
<p>“I have never seen a woman</p>
<p>even half as magnificent!”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>445 The old queen spoke unkind words</p>
<p>and said, “Son, this is a fiend</p>
<p>in this costly dress!</p>
<p>Since you have asked for my blessing,</p>
<p>do not ever go through with this wedding.</p>
<p>450 Christ forbids you to do it!”</p>
<p>Then the powerful sovereign said,</p>
<p>“Mother, I will possess this maiden!”</p>
<p>And he led her away.</p>
<p>The old queen, truthfully,</p>
<p>455 furiously went back home</p>
<p>and would not attend the wedding.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The king wed that radiant lady,</p>
<p>and great hospitality was arranged for there</p>
<p>in that beautiful hall.</p>
<p>460 Distinguished lords were served according to courtly protocol:</p>
<p>dukes, earls, barons, and knights</p>
<p>of high and low rank.</p>
<p>Many common folk, truthfully, were there</p>
<p>and a large crowd it was,</p>
<p>465 as is told in the tale.</p>
<p>There was all manner of things</p>
<p>befitting a royal wedding,</p>
<p>and many a famous entertainer.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When the eating was done,</p>
<p>470 the great lords,</p>
<p>who were beautiful to look at, soon departed.</p>
<p>The king departed with the queen.</p>
<p>Much love was between them,</p>
<p>and also joy and happiness.</p>
<p>475 She was well-mannered and delightful</p>
<p>—I have never heard of such a lady before—</p>
<p>and they loved each other from their noble hearts.</p>
<p>The lady who was both humble and compassionate</p>
<p>conceived and soon was pregnant</p>
<p>480 as God willed it to be.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>At that time, the King of France</p>
<p>was assailed by many “Saracens”</p>
<p>and [thus] encumbered with distress;</p>
<p>he sent for the King of <em>Galys</em></p>
<p>485 and other lords of great worth</p>
<p>who were beautiful to look at.</p>
<p>The King of <em>Galys</em>, at that time,</p>
<p>gathered men around him</p>
<p>in radiant and bright armor.</p>
<p>490 Then the king said to Sir Kadore</p>
<p>and other lords that were present,</p>
<p>“Take good care of my queen.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The King of France spared nobody,</p>
<p>but sent for all of them:</p>
<p>495 kings, knights, and clergy.</p>
<p>The steward who was left at home</p>
<p>to look after the queen [who was as] white as foam</p>
<p>did not join that mission.</p>
<p>She was pregnant […],</p>
<p>500 for as long as it was God’s will,</p>
<p>that beautiful one under her shift,</p>
<p>until from her body</p>
<p>a beautiful and handsome child was delivered</p>
<p>[who] had a double king’s mark.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>505 They christened him with great honor,</p>
<p>and called him Segramour;</p>
<p>that baby was of noble lineage.</p>
<p>Then the steward, Sir Kadore,</p>
<p>wrote a noble letter right away</p>
<p>510 and crafted it well.</p>
<p>He crafted it in haste,</p>
<p>and sent it to his lord, the king,</p>
<p>who was of noble lineage.</p>
<p>The messenger then went on his way.</p>
<p>515 He came by the king’s mother[‘s place]</p>
<p>and went into the castle.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>He was received splendidly</p>
<p>and she eagerly asked him</p>
<p>how the queen had been faring.</p>
<p>520 “My Lady, she has given birth to</p>
<p>a beautiful male child, I am telling you truthfully,</p>
<p>and she is lying in [child]bed.”</p>
<p>For this news, she gave him</p>
<p>a robe and forty shillings</p>
<p>525 and had him richly clothed.</p>
<p>She got him drunk on ale and wine</p>
<p>and when she saw that it was time,</p>
<p>she led him to his bedroom.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>And when he had fallen asleep,</p>
<p>530 the queen, who had an evil mind,</p>
<p>went to the chamber.</p>
<p>She took his letter from him</p>
<p>and then burnt it in a fire;</p>
<p>her machinations were unkind.</p>
<p>535 Maliciously, she made another letter</p>
<p>and said that the queen had given birth to a devil</p>
<p>[and that] nobody dared to come close to her.</p>
<p>[That her son] had three heads:</p>
<p>a lion’s, a dragon’s, and a bear’s,</p>
<p>540 and was a foul, hairy fiend.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>In the morning, when it was day,</p>
<p>the messenger went on his way,</p>
<p>both on the roads and the paths,</p>
<p>truthfully, as the story goes,</p>
<p>545 until he came to where the king was encamped,</p>
<p>and he spoke sweet words.</p>
<p>He delivered the letter to the king;</p>
<p>and as he read it, I understand,</p>
<p>[the king] let the tears stream down his face.</p>
<p>550 And as he stood reading,</p>
<p>he fell down, swooning;</p>
<p>his heart was bleeding from sorrow.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Noble lords that stood beside him</p>
<p>hastily helped the king up;</p>
<p>555 in his heart, he was filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>He wept bitterly and said, “Alas,</p>
<p>that I was ever born!</p>
<p>That it should ever be like this.</p>
<p>Alas, that I was made a king</p>
<p>560 and then wedded the fairest thing</p>
<p>that may walk on earth.</p>
<p>That Jesus himself would ever send</p>
<p>such a foul, loathly fiend,</p>
<p>to come between the two of us.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>565 When he saw it could not be helped,</p>
<p>he made another letter,</p>
<p>and sealed it with his seal.</p>
<p>He commanded that above all,</p>
<p>the young lady was to be kept safe</p>
<p>570 until she had recovered [from the birth];</p>
<p>everybody, righteous or evil,</p>
<p>was to serve her as she commanded</p>
<p>for better or worse.</p>
<p>[The messenger] took the letter from his hands,</p>
<p>575 and rode back along the same route</p>
<p>via the king’s mother’s castle.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>And then he stayed there all night;</p>
<p>he was received well and outfitted richly</p>
<p>and he was not aware of any treason.</p>
<p>580 He made himself comfortable, perfectly at ease,</p>
<p>with bread, ale, and wine,</p>
<p>and that robbed him of his senses.</p>
<p>When he fell asleep</p>
<p>the false queen looked for his letter,</p>
<p>585 she cast it into the fire</p>
<p>and made another letter,</p>
<p>[saying] that men should seize the lady</p>
<p>and lead her out of town</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>and cast her into the sea</p>
<p>590 in that robe of radiant hues,</p>
<p>along with her little child,</p>
<p>and let her have no allowance</p>
<p>for food or drink</p>
<p>but drive her out of that country.</p>
<p>595 “Show her no mercy,</p>
<p>or you will be punished by death</p>
<p>along with your own children and your wife!”</p>
<p>The messenger was completely unaware [of this]</p>
<p>and he rode home for many a mile</p>
<p>600 through forests and estates.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>And when the messenger came home</p>
<p>the steward quickly took the letter</p>
<p>and started to read.</p>
<p>He sighed heavily and said, “Alas,</p>
<p>605 certainly this is a foul case,</p>
<p>and a doleful deed!”</p>
<p>And as he stood reading,</p>
<p>he fell down swooning;</p>
<p>his heart was bleeding from sorrow.</p>
<p>610 There was nobody, neither old nor young,</p>
<p>who would not weep</p>
<p>for that worthy one underneath her dress.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The lady heard the great clamour in the hall.</p>
<p>She called the steward</p>
<p>615 and said, “What can this be about?</p>
<p>If anything is amiss,</p>
<p>tell me what it is</p>
<p>and conceal nothing from me.”</p>
<p>Then the steward said, truthfully,</p>
<p>620 “Lo, my lord has sent a letter,</p>
<p>and that is why I am distressed!”</p>
<p>She took the letter and began to read.</p>
<p>There she found the entire command written down:</p>
<p>how she must [be thrown] into the sea.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>625 “Be quiet, Sir,” said the queen,</p>
<p>“Refrain from such mourning</p>
<p>for my sake.</p>
<p>Make sure that you will not be disgraced</p>
<p>but do my lord’s bidding.</p>
<p>630 God forbid you spare [me].</p>
<p>Because he made such a poor marriage,</p>
<p>with me, a plain lady,</p>
<p>he is profoundly ashamed.</p>
<p>Send my greetings to my lord.</p>
<p>635 Nevermore will he obtain</p>
<p>[one] of such noble lineage in all Christendom.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Then there was misery and much sorrow</p>
<p>when the lady had to go to the ship.</p>
<p>They wept and wrought their hands.</p>
<p>640 The lady who was humble and compassionate</p>
<p>bore the child in her arms</p>
<p>and took leave of the land.</p>
<p>When she went into the sea</p>
<p>in the robe of radiant hues,</p>
<p>645 people swooned on the beach.</p>
<p>They wept bitterly and said, “Alas,</p>
<p>this is certainly a cruel case.</p>
<p>Cursed be malicious deeds!”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The lady and the little child</p>
<p>650 drifted away on the raging water</p>
<p>in a stroke of bad luck.</p>
<p>Her surcoat was large and wide:</p>
<p>she sheltered her face</p>
<p>in its outer folds;</p>
<p>655 she was afraid of the sea,</p>
<p>and lay face downward on a plank</p>
<p>with the child at her breast.</p>
<p>The waves were huge and forceful;</p>
<p>they violently flogged the boat</p>
<p>660 with many harsh thuds.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>And when the child began to weep</p>
<p>she sang it to sleep with a heavy heart</p>
<p>and put her nipple into his mouth</p>
<p>and said, “If only I could get to land</p>
<p>665 from this sea which is so fierce,</p>
<p>whether in the North or South!</p>
<p>I ought to curse you, Sea,</p>
<p>you are causing me such disgrace!”</p>
<p>And she lay there the whole time and grieved,</p>
<p>670 then she prayed</p>
<p>to Jesus and His dear Mother</p>
<p>in all the ways that she knew.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Now this lady remained there</p>
<p>for a full seven nights and longer,</p>
<p>675 as was God’s will.</p>
<p>With a frightened heart and sighing heavily,</p>
<p>she had been destined for such misfortune long ago,</p>
<p>and she lay very still.</p>
<p>She was driven towards Rome</p>
<p>680 through the grace of God on His throne</p>
<p>who pervades all things.</p>
<p>While at sea she was harassed so badly</p>
<p>[that she was] almost crazed from hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>Cursed be ill chance!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>685 A merchant lived in that city,</p>
<p>a rich man who owned gold and bonds;</p>
<p>Jurdan was his name.</p>
<p>Every day he would</p>
<p>go and amuse himself on the beach</p>
<p>690 and go outside for a walk.</p>
<p>While he was out,</p>
<p>walking by the seaside</p>
<p>by himself, all alone,</p>
<p>he found a boat by the shore,</p>
<p>695 and a beautiful lady inside</p>
<p>who was very wretched.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The fabric on her gleamed so radiantly</p>
<p>that he was terrified by the sight</p>
<p>because of the glistening that came from the dress.</p>
<p>700 And in his heart he was convinced</p>
<p>that she was not an earthly being.</p>
<p>Never had he seen such folk.</p>
<p>He said, “What are you called, fair lady?”</p>
<p>“Lord,” she said, “I am called Egaré,</p>
<p>705 who lies here in terror.”</p>
<p>He helped the beautiful lady up</p>
<p>and the young child that was with her</p>
<p>and he led them home.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When he came to his residence,</p>
<p>710 he appropriately received that young lady</p>
<p>who was beautiful and radiant,</p>
<p>and he asked his wife</p>
<p>to bring all kinds of food and drink</p>
<p>to that lady right away.</p>
<p>715 “Whatever she craves</p>
<p>and her mouth wants to have,</p>
<p>see that it is readily prepared for her.</p>
<p>She has been without food for so long</p>
<p>that I think it is a great pity.</p>
<p>720 Comfort her if you can.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Now the lady lived there.</p>
<p>She had all good foods</p>
<p>at her beck and call.</p>
<p>She was courteous in every respect</p>
<p>725 to both the old and the young.</p>
<p>Both the righteous and the evil adored her.</p>
<p>The child began to thrive.</p>
<p>He grew into the fairest child alive,</p>
<p>white as a flower on the hill.</p>
<p>730 And she sewed silkwork in her bower</p>
<p>and taught her son good manners,</p>
<p>but she always mourned quietly.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When the child was seven years old,</p>
<p>he was both discerning and courageous,</p>
<p>735 and well formed in flesh and bone.</p>
<p>He was worthy under his clothing.</p>
<p>And he knew very well how to handle a steed.</p>
<p>There was no other child as courteous.</p>
<p>Everbody loved Segramour,</p>
<p>740 in the hall and in the bower,</p>
<p>wherever he went.</p>
<p>Now we shall leave our tale of the lady who is unspoiled by vice</p>
<p>and speak instead of the King of “Galys”</p>
<p>when he comes home from the siege.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>745 Now that the siege is over,</p>
<p>the king comes home to “Galys”</p>
<p>with great joy and pride.</p>
<p>Dukes and earls of prosperous estates,</p>
<p>barons and knights who were of great worth</p>
<p>750 come riding by his side.</p>
<p>Sir Kadore, who had been his steward,</p>
<p>rode towards him with many a man</p>
<p>as fast as he could.</p>
<p>He told the king the fortunes</p>
<p>755 of his halls and his bowers</p>
<p>and of his wide lands.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The king said, “For God’s sake,</p>
<p>Sir Kadore, you are to blame</p>
<p>for what you have told me first!</p>
<p>760 You should have told me first</p>
<p>of my lady Egaré</p>
<p>whom I love above all things!”</p>
<p>Then the steward’s heart sank</p>
<p>and [he] said, “Lord, why do you say so?</p>
<p>765 Are you not a steadfast king?</p>
<p>Look here at the letter you sent me.</p>
<p>You may see it for yourself:</p>
<p>I have done your bidding.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The king took the letter to read it</p>
<p>770 and when he saw the aforementioned document [the letter]</p>
<p>he went very pale and wan.</p>
<p>He cried out deeply and said, “Alas,</p>
<p>that I was ever born,</p>
<p>or was ever made a man!</p>
<p>775 Sir Kadore, by my life,</p>
<p>this letter never originated with me,</p>
<p>I am telling you here and now.”</p>
<p>They both wept and berated themselves.</p>
<p>“Alas!” they said, “May God’s will be done!”</p>
<p>780 And then they both swooned.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Distinguished lords stood nearby</p>
<p>and they hastily helped up the king;</p>
<p>he was a wretched sight.</p>
<p>And when they had both recovered</p>
<p>785 the king examined the letter</p>
<p>about the three heads:</p>
<p>“Oh Lord,” he said, “by God’s grace,</p>
<p>I have never seen this letter before!</p>
<p>Alas, how can this be?”</p>
<p>790 They sent for the messenger.</p>
<p>The king asked which way he had gone:</p>
<p>“Lord, past your noble mother’s.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>“Alas!” the king then said.</p>
<p>“Could my mother be so discourteous</p>
<p>795 as to commit this treason?</p>
<p>By my crown, she shall be burned</p>
<p>without a trial.</p>
<p>That seems to me the most just course of action!”</p>
<p>Between them, the distinguished lords decided</p>
<p>800 that they would exile the queen</p>
<p>and deprive her of her rank.</p>
<p>Thus they exiled the malicious queen</p>
<p>and stripped her of all her privileges,</p>
<p>castles, towers, and towns.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>805 When she was cast out upon the sea foam,</p>
<p>the noble king remained at home</p>
<p>in a miserable state.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart and a mournful mind</p>
<p>he sighed a lot</p>
<p>810 for the beautiful Egaré.</p>
<p>And when he saw children playing,</p>
<p>he wept and said, “Oh, woe, woe,</p>
<p>for my son who is so dear to me!”</p>
<p>That was his life for many days,</p>
<p>815 [and] nobody could put an end to [his suffering]</p>
<p>for a full seven years—</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>until [one day] a thought came into his heart:</p>
<p>how his lady who was white as foam</p>
<p>had been drowned for his sake.</p>
<p>820 “Through the grace of God on His throne,</p>
<p>I want to see the Pope in Rome,</p>
<p>to receive my penance!”</p>
<p>He had many ships prepared</p>
<p>and loaded them with worldly wealth</p>
<p>825 with which to make his men merry.</p>
<p>He had alms distributed</p>
<p>in order to gain salvation for his soul,</p>
<p>[then] he made his way to the ship.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Sailors who were very skilled</p>
<p>830 prepared the rigging,</p>
<p>which was beautiful and precious, in a splendid manner.</p>
<p>They hoisted the sails and positioned the rudder;</p>
<p>the wind was as they had desired,</p>
<p>the weather was pleasant and calm.</p>
<p>835 They sailed over the salty foam,</p>
<p>by the grace of God on His throne</p>
<p>who is most powerful of all.</p>
<p>When they came to that city,</p>
<p>[the king] took his lodgings at the burgher’s house</p>
<p>840 where Emaré lived.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Emaré called her son to</p>
<p>come to her quickly</p>
<p>without any delay</p>
<p>and said, “My dear noble son,</p>
<p>845 do as I tell you,</p>
<p>and you shall have my blessing.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you shall serve in the hall</p>
<p>in a gown of splendid silk</p>
<p>in front of this noble king.</p>
<p>850 Look, son, you are so well-mannered</p>
<p>that no one could find your match</p>
<p>in any manner of things!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>“When the king is served dessert,</p>
<p>kneel down hastily</p>
<p>855 and take his hand in yours.</p>
<p>And when you have done so,</p>
<p>quickly take the golden chalice</p>
<p>and serve him wine.</p>
<p>And then come quickly</p>
<p>860 and tell me what he says to you,</p>
<p>by God’s and my grace!”</p>
<p>The child went into the hall,</p>
<p>among the greater and lesser nobles,</p>
<p>who was lovely underneath the linen.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>865 Then the lords, who were distinguished,</p>
<p>washed [their hands] and proceeded to eat;</p>
<p>servants brought in the courses.</p>
<p>The child served them so gracefully</p>
<p>that everyone who saw him loved him</p>
<p>870 and gave him much praise.</p>
<p>Then all who looked at him said</p>
<p>that they had never seen such a courteous child,</p>
<p>either in halls or in bowers.</p>
<p>The king said to him, in jest,</p>
<p>875 “Sweet son, what is your name?”</p>
<p>“Lord,” he said, “I am called Segramour.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Then that noble king</p>
<p>started to sigh heavily,</p>
<p>because his son was also called that.</p>
<p>880 The truth is—I am not lying—</p>
<p>the tears were filling his eyes;</p>
<p>in his heart he was very sorrowful.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he did not inquire further,</p>
<p>but looked upon the child who was so noble</p>
<p>885 and felt much love for him in that instant.</p>
<p>The king then said to the burgher:</p>
<p>“Sweet Sir, is this your son?”</p>
<p>The burgher said: “Yes.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Then the distinguished lords</p>
<p>890 cleaned [their hands] after the meal</p>
<p>and in came the sweet course.</p>
<p>The child, who was of a pleasant disposition,</p>
<p>knelt down on his knee</p>
<p>and served [the king] courteously.</p>
<p>895 The king called the burgher to tell him,</p>
<p>saying: “Sir, if you are willing,</p>
<p>give me this little body!</p>
<p>I shall make him a lord over towns and fortresses,</p>
<p>over high halls and bowers.</p>
<p>900 I feel a particular affection for him.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When he had served the king for a while</p>
<p>[the child] went to his mother</p>
<p>to tell her how things stood.</p>
<p>“Son, when he turns to go to his chamber,</p>
<p>905 take his hand [...]</p>
<p>because he is your father, no doubt;</p>
<p>and bid him to come and speak with Emaré</p>
<p>who changed her name to Egaré</p>
<p>in the land of ‘Galys.’”</p>
<p>910 The child went again to the hall</p>
<p>among all the distinguished lords</p>
<p>and served them splendidly.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>When they were finally satisfied</p>
<p>with bread, ale, and wine,</p>
<p>915 they rose up, more or less.</p>
<p>When the king was to go to his chamber,</p>
<p>[Segramour] took his hand [...]</p>
<p>and helped him inside;</p>
<p>he said: “Sir, if you may,</p>
<p>920 take me by your hand and go with me,</p>
<p>because I am of your kin!</p>
<p>You shall come speak with Emaré</p>
<p>who changed her name to Egaré</p>
<p>and who bears a white chin.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>925 In his heart, the king was miserable</p>
<p>when he heard the [child’s] speech</p>
<p>about the one who had been his queen</p>
<p>and [he] said, “Son, why do you say so?</p>
<p>Why do you reproach me with my misery?</p>
<p>930 That may never be!”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he went with him.</p>
<p>The noble lady came towards them</p>
<p>in the bright and glistening robe.</p>
<p>[The king] took her into his two arms;</p>
<p>935 they both swooned from joy,</p>
<p>such was the love between them.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>That was a joyful meeting there,</p>
<p>[the king] freely folding that lady,</p>
<p>so virtuous under her garment,</p>
<p>into his arms.</p>
<p>940 Lord! Sir Kadore was glad,</p>
<p>as were the other lords who were present there</p>
<p>—beautiful to behold—</p>
<p>to see that the lady who had been put to sea,</p>
<p>through the grace of God in Trinity,</p>
<p>945 had been restored from cold care.</p>
<p>We shall now leave the lady who was as white as a flower,</p>
<p>and speak of her father, the emperor,</p>
<p>of whom this tale first told.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>By then, her father the emperor</p>
<p>950 had become an old man,</p>
<p>and [he] thought of his sin,</p>
<p>[and] of his daughter Emaré,</p>
<p>who had been put to sea,</p>
<p>and who had had such luminous skin.</p>
<p>955 He thought that he would go</p>
<p>to the Pope to receive his penance there,</p>
<p>and gain [entry to] Heaven.</p>
<p>He soon sent messengers ahead</p>
<p>and they came to the Roman court</p>
<p>960 to take lodgings for their lord.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Emaré implored her lord, the king,</p>
<p>“Sir, wait for that lord who is coming,</p>
<p>who is so handsome and noble,</p>
<p>and, sweet Sir, above all,</p>
<p>965 acquaint yourself with that lord;</p>
<p>it is an honor for you.”</p>
<p>The King of <em>Galys</em> then said,</p>
<p>“There is no lord so great</p>
<p>in all Christendom.”</p>
<p>970 “Now, sweet Sir, whatever happens,</p>
<p>ride towards that lord,</p>
<p>and all your knights with you.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Emaré, anticipating the emperor’s arrival,</p>
<p>instructed her young son</p>
<p>975 on how it should be done:</p>
<p>“Sweet son, above all,</p>
<p>be ready with my lord, the king,</p>
<p>and be my sweet son!</p>
<p>When the emperor kisses your noble father,</p>
<p>980 see if he will return the kiss,</p>
<p>then bow down before him</p>
<p>and ask him to come speak with Emaré</p>
<p>who was put to sea.</p>
<p>He himself gave the command.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>985 Now the worthy emperor arrived;</p>
<p>the King of “Galys” rode to meet him</p>
<p>with much honor.</p>
<p>The child was worthy under his dress</p>
<p>and sat upon a noble steed</p>
<p>990 by his father’s side;</p>
<p>and when he met the emperor</p>
<p>he lowered his hood with great honor,</p>
<p>and kissed him that time,</p>
<p>and other lords of great courage</p>
<p>995 also kissed Segramour,</p>
<p>that is the truth of it.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The Emperor’s heart was greatly enamored</p>
<p>by the child who rode by his side</p>
<p>with such a lovely disposition.</p>
<p>1000 Segramour reined in his steed,</p>
<p>his own father listened carefully,</p>
<p>and so did the other lords who were present.</p>
<p>The child spoke to the emperor</p>
<p>and said, “Lord, for the sake of your honor</p>
<p>1005 mark my words:</p>
<p>you shall come and speak with Emaré</p>
<p>who changed her name to Egaré</p>
<p>who was your dear daughter.”</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The emperor grew very pale</p>
<p>1010 and said, “Son, why do you reproach me with grief</p>
<p>when you cannot see any remedy?”</p>
<p>“Sir, if you come with me now</p>
<p>I shall bring forth that noble lady</p>
<p>who is lovely to look at.”</p>
<p>1015 Nevertheless, he [the emperor] went with him.</p>
<p>The noble lady came towards him,</p>
<p>walking on foot.</p>
<p>And the emperor dismounted</p>
<p>and took her into his two arms;</p>
<p>1020 he embraced her and kissed her sweetly.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>That was a joyful meeting</p>
<p>of the emperor and the king,</p>
<p>and also of Emaré,</p>
<p>and Sir Segramour was also there,</p>
<p>1025 who later became emperor—</p>
<p>he was a very good man.</p>
<p>They held a great feast</p>
<p>with valiant earls and barons,</p>
<p>as the story tells.</p>
<p>1030 This is one of the Breton lays</p>
<p>that has been told since the olden days.</p>
<p>Men call it <em>Playn d’Egarye</em>.</p>
<p>Jesus on Your throne,</p>
<p>grant us to live with You</p>
<p>1035 in perpetual glory! Amen.</p>
<p>Here ends <em>Emaré.</em></p>
<p><br/></p>


<h2>Critical Notes</h2>

<p><i>Line 7:</i> The Middle English grammar shifts between addressing Mary in the second person (imperative, <i>bere</i> in l. 8, 10) and talking about her in the third person (I. 9).</p>

<p><i>Line 8:</i> Literally: “Bear our message/prayer in between.” Mary and the Saints are intercessors between a human and God. It is easier to appeal to the saints or to Mary than to God directly.</p>

<p><i>Line 9:</i> Variations of this line (“That semely ys of sight”) are reiterated throughout the poem and in most cases “that” (who or what is beautiful to look at) has multiple referents. Here, an alternative referent is <i>arunde</i>: “Mary, heavenly queen, bear our message in between [heaven and earth] so that it is of gracious appearance.” As this grammatical ambiguity might be precisely the point, some instances of this line will retain their ambiguity in translation.</p>

<p><i>Line 13:</i> Middle English <i>minstral</i> is a term for professional entertainers, self-employed or working as court functionaries, who would perform as storytellers, musicians, singers, actors, jugglers, and occasionally as servants.</p>

<p><i>Line 85:</i> All editions but Rickert omit <i>hyȝte</i> and all editions end the line with a comma. White’s diplomatic transcription reads “Syr Tergaunte þt nobyll knyȝt hyȝte”, p. 327. Rickert puts <i>hyȝte</i> in brackets and adds, “The omission of <i>hyȝte</i> improves the metre; but although the <i>yȝ</i> is blotted, the word is not unmistakingly crossed out by the scribe. Kölbing, however, considers it erased (Eng. Stud., xv, 248)”, p. 3 note 5. Laskaya and Salisbury omit <i>hyghte</i> in the main text, but add in their apparatus, note 85: “The MS includes the word <i>hyght</i> at the end of the line. The word is blotted and, since it disrupts the meter, Kö[lbing] and G[ough] considered it erased. Ru[mble], M[ills], and F[rench] &amp; H[ale] all leave the word out; R[ickert] leaves it in.” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#85. I agree with Rickert’s interpretation of the text, as blots are common throughout the manuscript and as <i>hyȝten</i> takes on the grammatical function of a predicate. The next line has a full SPO structure; introducing Tergaunte in a full rather than elliptic sentence makes sense from a grammatical point of view, even if it irregularizes the metre.</p>

<p><i>Line 86:</i> Two senses of <i>ryghte</i>, adv., would fit in this context: “Suitably for the purpose, well, thoroughly, properly; […],” i.e., as one should present gifts to an emperor, bending the knee, etc.; “sincerely,” i.e., like the emir’s daughter in l.110, with no false intentions. See https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED37511/track?counter=4&amp;search_id=11749846.</p>

<p><i>Line 89:</i> Rickert notes that <i>was dye</i> (crossed out) precedes <i>pyght</i> in the MS; this is neither rendered in White’s transcription nor commented on by Laskaya and Salisbury.</p>

<p><i>Line 94:</i> <i>nakette</i>: the MED’s only quotations for <i>nakette</i> as agate are from Emaré. See https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED29047/track?counter=1&amp;search_id=11382432. Laskaya and Salisbury consider “agate,” as explained in note 94: “<i>Nakette</i> is ‘agate,’ with the <i>n</i> from the definite article allided to the initial vowel.” See https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#94. Gough agrees (p. 35). Rickert, however, proposes „perhaps (n)achate” (p. 35, note 4/95) but adds, “[t]he text shows a tendency to write <i>e</i> for <i>a</i>, as: <i>cledde, wesh, wes</i>; but ‘Destruction of Troy’ has <i>achatas, Wars of Alexander, acats</i>. Or, the word may be some derivative (perhaps corrupted) from <i>nacre</i> = mother-of-pearl.There is also a rare stone <em>echite</em>, but this is more remote phonetically. Cf. also Godefroi under <em>nace</em> = cloth of gold.” Line 244 refers to the robe shaped from Tergaunte’s gift as “cloth of golde.” Historical variations of “pearl” appear closer to <em>nakettes</em> than <em>nacre</em>: the OED lists occurences of “post-classical <em>naccara, nacara</em> mother-of-pearl” in 1295 and 1347, and points to the Italian loan word <em>naqqāra</em> from Arabic for kettledrum, which in turn likely relates back to “the technical language of pearlers in the Gulf region.” See https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124778?redirectedFrom=nacre&amp;. Compare with the <em>Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch</em> vol. 19 col. 137b–138a, which provides a similar etymology for Old French <em>(a)nacaire</em>, It. <em>(g)naccera</em>, Cat. <em>nacra</em>, Sp. <em>nàcara</em>. The term entered the lexicon in the time of the crusades. https://lecteur-few.atilf.fr/lire/190/137.</p>

<p><i>Lines 98–101:</i> “The emperor could not establish visual power over the cloth and was unable to hold his gaze and penetrate the cloth with it.” This is due to the stones. Stones, in medieval scientific discourse, were believed to possess powers (which may be reflected in the repeated use of <i>myche prise</i> to qualify the stones and is referenced directly by the virtues of emeralds, l. 152). Encyclopedias or stone books, called lapidaries, would present virtues which manifest in color, hue, and radiance, and in medicinal, talismanic, and spiritual uses. Laskaya and Salisbury, notes 91, 94, 127–130, 139, 152–156 provide some of the cloth’s individual stones’ virtues as accounted for in select lapidaries. More important for the meaning of ll. 99–101 is that a frequent lithic power across various gemstones is their capacity to reflect or even to emit endogenic light. By reflecting the emperor’s gaze back and dazzling him with blinding light, the stones “refuse” to be discerned and prevent him from reading the lithic mosaic text of lovers recounted in the following lines. Thus, they in turn establish power over the emperor. Grammatically, l. 100, “For glysteryng of the ryche ston,” could either explain the preceding or the subsequent line: “The emperor was not able to discern anything on the cloth because of the light emitted/reflected by the stones” or “Because of the light emitted/reflected by the stones, he could not establish visual access.” In any case, <em>Emaré</em> emphasizes the emperor’s temporary blindness and attributes it to the stones.</p>

<p><i>Line 108:</i> As medieval manuscripts do not use punctuation, it is unclear whether the following description of the cloth is in the voice of an omniscient narrator or in the voice of Tergaunte, who has brought the gift. Laskaya and Salisbury and Rickert indicate that Tergaunte ends his speech here (l. 108) and speaks again in ll. 172–177, which would leave the description to the heterodiegetic narrator. French and Hale extend his speech to l. 113. Perkins cautions against “the absolute boundary that modern punctuation creates here, and the point of view that it creates.” See “Ekphrasis and Narrative in Emaré and Sir Eglamour of Artois.” <em>Medieval Romance, Medieval Contexts</em>, edited by Rhiannon Purdie, Brewer, 2011. Studies in Medieval Romance, pp. 47–68 (p. 58).</p>

<p><i>Line 109:</i> <i>hethenes</i> means “non-Christian people”. From the subsequent ranks (emir, sultan), the place-name Babylon, which could refer to present-day Cairo, and the fact that Muslim-held territories produced, along with Byzantium, the most coveted fabrics and silks to a higher technical and material standard than available in the Latin West, the meaning “Muslim” can be inferred. Sicily in turn remained multi-ethnic and multi-religious for centuries after the Muslim (Byzantine) conquest in the ninth century and the Norman (Latin Christian) conquest in the twelfth century. Note that the poem uses two different terms, <i>hethen</i> for the princess but <i>Saracen</i> for an enemy that is a religious Other (l. 481, note 71).</p>

<p><i>Line 110:</i> <i>wythouten lees</i>, as a fixed phrase and rhyme tag, asserts truth. In a more literal sense, the emir’s daughter’s intentions may have been honest, i.e. <i>wythouten lees</i>. See https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED34602/track?counter=3&amp;search_id=11382432.</p>

<p><i>Line 111:</i> <i>wyth pryde</i> is ambiguous: both negative and positive senses of pride—honorable, vainglorious—would fit. By way of such ambiguous descriptors, the cloth becomes multivalent, which reflects in the multivalency of Emaré later on, who, when she wears the fabric, is perceived by different characters as a fairy or demon, as a noble woman, and as an object or a treasure trove. See https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED34602/track?counter=3&amp;search_id=11382432.</p>

<p><i>Line 123:</i> The referent of this line is unclear: it could either be Amadas and Ydoine (i.e. as a faithful couple), or the mode of embroidering (i.e. being one of faithful love).</p>

<p><i>Line 125:</i> Line 125 Rickert, p. 36, note 5/125, identifies this flower with the “Herb Paris (Paris Quadrifolia), similar to trillium” whose leaves are set “to resemble a true-love knot”; she cites its use in <i>Sir Degravent</i> (ll. 1032, 1039, 1484), <i>The Awntyrs off Arthure at the Terne Wathelyne</i> (ll. 354, 510), <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> (l. 612), and <i>The Tale of Ralph Collier</i> (l. 473); she assumes the actual herb was worked into the cloth as a magical charm. Medieval silk embroidery, however, would often include scattered vegetal or figural ornaments.</p>

<p><i>Line 142:</i> <i>nakettes</i>, see note for l. 94.</p>

<p><i>Line 149:</i> See note for l. 151.</p>

<p><i>Line 151: </i> Rickert, p. 36, note 5/151, remarks: “Possibly here as in l. 131 the pattern suddenly intrudes upon the materials; but the names of stones are expected. If the poem was at any time taken down from hearing, the line might have been corrupted by ‘Ther wer onyx and centaureus,’ which would rhyme correctly with <i>vertues</i>. My authority for <i>centaureus</i> is Heinrich von Neustadt (quoted by Smith, Shakespeare’s Pericles and Apollonius of Tyre, Philadelphia, 1898, pp. 75–76); the nearest that Pannier [<em>Les Lapidaires Français</em>, Paris, 1882, index] gives is <em>ceraunus</em>. The plant, <em>centaurus</em>, was well known.” Laskaya and Salisbury also note that “knyghtus and senatowres […] seem out of place in a list of gems.” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#151. Gough concurs, p. 35.</p>

<p><i>Line 158:</i> Based on dreams and visions in Books 2 and 7 of Daniel, medieval Christian historiography developed the theory of four kingdoms, or ages, to follow each other before the end of days: the first kingdom would be the Babylonian Empire, the second the Persian Empire, the third the Greek Empire (Alexander the Great), the final earthly kingdom the Roman Empire. Rulership, knowledge, and literature would be “translated” from one empire to the next ( <i>translatio imperii</i>). Babylon could simultaneously refer to the historical empire and to contemporary Cairo. In the context of the “translated” cloth, both associations come together.</p>

<p><i>Line 172:</i> See note for l. 108 on speech marks.</p>

<p><i>Line 174:</i> Ritson omits the MS’s <i>wyth</i>; it is included by Rickert and Laskaya and Salisbury.</p>

<p><i>Line 187:</i> Ritson, without commentary, changes to <i>Remeneth</i>.</p>

<p><i>Line 216:</i> Romances are a narrative genre. Frequent subject matters are Arthurian tales (such as <i>Tristan and Iseut</i>) or stories of the repeated union and separation of lovers (such as <i>Floire and Blanchefleur</i> and <i>Amadas and Ydoine</i>). <i>romans</i>, as it spelled in l. 216, can also simply mean “French” and thus implicate a French source. Many romances were in fact copied or adapted from French into English.</p>

<p><i>Line 234:</i> As marriage was considered a sacrament, any commitments outside of clerical law would have to be sanctioned by a clerical authority, which is represented here by the Pope. Historically, noble families might appeal to the Pope if a marriage was not in line with clerical regulations regarding consanguinity, either to go ahead with a planned alliance or to dissolve an existing one. After the Fourth Lateran council of 1215, which relaxed regulations, any relations within the fourth degree were considered consanguinuous. Certain spiritual relations were also prohibited, such as adoptive and baptismal relations (godparents), as well as immediate relatives of deceased partners—as partners were believed to become one flesh by the sacrament of marriage (<em>una caro</em> doctrine). This would greatly limit the choice of eligible partners for feudal families who sought to enhance their power through marriage alliances, but it also gave leeway to rid themselves of partners who had become undesirable. A famous example of the application and contestation of incest laws is Henry VIII’s (failed) attempt to receive a papal bull allowing him to dissolve his marriage to Catherine of Aragon on the grounds of incest, as she had previously been wedded to his brother. There are no historical cases of father-daughter marriages sanctioned by any Pope, but nuclear family incest, especially a daughter’s flight from her incestuous father, is a recurring theme in medieval literature, as is the unsavory role of the Pope in the “maiden without hands” tradition.</p>

<p><i>Line 246:</i> Literally “who was made of clay.” Adam, the first human, was believed to have been created by God from dust.</p>

<p><i>Line 272:</i> Ritson adds “[givying]” to the line, explaining: “It is very singular that these lines should nearly occur again in V. 593: ‘And lette her have no spending, / For no mete, ny for drynke.’ Thus in the original; but as the word <i>drynke</i> by no means answers in rhyme to <i>spendyng</i>; and either line is too short for the metre […] the editor has taken the liberty to insert, after <i>drynke</i>, in the first passage, (giving), and to alter it, in the other, to <i>drynkynge</i> […]” (p. 194). No other edition follows this conjecture.</p>

<p><i>Line 275:</i> The protagonist’s exposure in a rudderless vessel is a defining motif of the “maiden without hands” tradition.</p>

<p><i>Line 287:</i> Ritson replaces the MS’s <i>toke yn</i> with <i>toke up</i>, p. 194.</p>

<p><i>Line 288:</i> Ritson reads “consorted”, Laskaya and Salisbury “comforted”, Rickert “conforted”, White transcribes “cōforted.”</p>

<p><i>Line 293:</i> Ritson suggests emending to “that I am!”, p. 194.</p>

<p><i>Line 310:</i> The MS inserts “now” in the margin with a caret: “At þe emꝑor ^ leve we ^now.” Compare White, p. 329 (f. 72vb).</p>

<p><i>Line 331:</i> This line, in the MS, is followed by “That hyght Galys y unþrstond.” Compare White, p. 329 (f. 72vb). This crossed out line is repeated in l. 338.</p>

<p><i>Line 338:</i> Galys is identified by some as Wales. See, most recently, Corinne Saunders, “Ch. 11: The Romance Genre,” in <i>A Companion to British literature</i>, ed. by Heesok Chang, Samantha Zacher, and Robert DeMaria, Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture (Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2014, pp. 161–79, (p. 167)). Others have identified it as Galicia in Spain, most recently Amy Burge and Lydia Kertz. ‘Fabricated Muslim Identity, Female Agency, and Cultural Complicity: The Imperial Project of <em>Emaré</em> ’, <i>Medieval Feminist Forum: A Journal of Gender and Sexuality</i>, 56.1 (2020), pp. 38–69 (p. 29). There are no conclusive arguments for either. The majority of adaptations of the story-type of <em>Emaré</em> provide a Mediterranean setting; at the same time, <em>Emaré</em> ’s association with the Breton lays and certain names such as Artyus, Segramour, or Erayne, make an Arthurian setting and thus Wales likely. To prevent forcing a certain interpretation of the poem upon readers, I leave this place name untranslated.</p>

<p><i>Line 345:</i> Line 345 Andrew M. Richmond draws attention to Sir Kadore’s and later Jurdan’s (ll. 688–690) play as a form of beachcombing. “‘The broken schippus he ther fonde’: Shipwrecks and the Human Costs of Investment Capital in Middle English Romance.” Neophilologus, 99.2 (2015), pp. 315–33, (pp. 326–27). This resonates with the sense of ME play as “gamble”. https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED33654/track?counter=2&amp;search_id=11382432.</p>

<p><i>Line 357:</i> Laskaya and Salisbury note that the MS spells <i>poyn</i>, which is “universally emended to poynt.” See https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#357.</p>

<p><i>Line 360:</i>An audience knowing French would recognize her alias’ similarity to the Old French/Anglo Norman <em>esgaré(e)</em>: outcast, lost, stray.</p>

<p><i>Line 377:</i> Ritson does not indicate having emended <i>sylkyn</i> and White, p. 330 (f. 73rb), transcribes <i>sylkyn</i>, but Laskaya and Salisbury note “MS: <i>sylkly</i> is partially erased; I have emended to <i>sylkyn</i> following M[ills, ed.]; F[rench]&amp;H[ale, ed.], and Ru[mble, ed.].” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#377. Rickert, also reads the MS as <i>sylkly</i> and adds that “a letter has evidently been erased after it,” p. 12, note 3.</p>

<p><i>Line 391:</i> While audiences are aware of her nobility, Emaré/Egaré presents as a “nobody” in Galys. The phrase plays on this tension and taps into medieval literary representations of saints, whose ordeal is a “low” life despite their high birth.</p>

<p><i>Line 409:</i> Ritson does not indicate having emended <i>called</i> and White, p. 330 (f. 73rb), transcribes <i>called</i>, but Laskaya and Salisbury indicate that the MS spells <i>calle<./i>. https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#409.</p>

<p><i>Line 411:</i> Laskaya and Salisbury and Rickert note, as White’s transcription indicates, that this line was added in the margin of the MS.</p>

<p><i>Line 415:</i> Laskaya and Salisbury gloss <i>ryche yn ray</i> as “array” but point to Mills’ emendation to <i>ryche ray</i> in accordance with l. 430. Gough, p. 37, notes that “all three lines [containing <em>ray</em>, 415, 430, 451] are metrically defective. <em>Ray</em> is a kind of striped cloth, O. Fr. <em>drap de ray</em> […].[There is a]nother word <em>ray</em> = prince […]. The scribe may have been misled by one of these words.” Rickert, p. 40, note 14/430, lists quotations for <em>ryche ray</em> in the sense of “powerful sovereign” as an interpretation to ll. 415, 430, and 451. It is unclear whether to translate as “the powerful sovereign” or “the powerful one in array/striped cloth.”</p>

<p><i>Line 441:</i> In medieval literature, nobility often manifests in a radiant body and in noble behavior, such as the mastery of certain courtly activities (chess and board games, dance and music, certain athletic skills in men, silk-working skills in women); often, other characters recognize the nobility of impoverished protagonists through such manifestations. In <i>Emaré</i>, there are no clear-cut signs, rather, there is only the multivalent robe which her mother-in-law suspects to be of demonic or otherwise unsavory origin.</p>

<p><i>Line 444:</i> gay operates on a spectrum of positive to negative senses that each fit the context, from “handsomely attired, shining, beautiful, noble,” to “lewd, lascivious.” https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED18063/track?counter=3&amp;search_id=11382432.</p>

<p><i>Line 482:</i> “Saracen” is a (Roman) Christian term for a non-(Roman)-Christian or otherwise Orientalized Other. In the tradition of crusading literature especially, it is frequently but not exclusively mapped onto Muslim Arabs. It conflates categories such as faith, ethnicity, and race. The “Saracens” of the literary crusading tradition, which encompasses epic, romance, saint’s lives, and chronicles, are written from a Latin (Roman Catholic) perspective which associates them with a range of negative attributes such as idolatry, ignorance, monstrosity, and physical deformity. This is why, in Shokoofeh Rajazabdeh’s words, the term is “not a depoliticized substitute for Muslim.” “The Depoliticized Saracen and Muslim Erasure.” <em>Literature Compass</em>, vol. 16, 9-10, 2019, p. 3/8. To avoid erasing or reproducing the discursive violence attached to the term, I have not translated it, but signaled its constructedness typographically. <i>Emaré</i> uses this term when tapping into a narrative mode of crusading, but employs a more general term for the non-Christian Other when describing the origin of the textile with the <i>hethenes</i>, in l. 109.</p>

<p><i>Line 496:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>stward</i> to <i>stiward</i>, p. 200.</p>

<p><i>Line 499:</i> The meaning of “yn place” is obscure. Laskaya and Salisbury note that it has been variously interpreted: “R[ickert, ed.] suggests that the line be emended to ‘yn thylke place’ meaning ‘as it was her place to do.’ Ru[mble, ed.] interpolates place so that it becomes palace: ‘She wente wyth chylde yn palace.’ F[rench]&amp;H[ale, ed.] gloss ‘place’ as ‘there’.” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#499.</p>

<p><i>Line 504:</i> Some literary noble children who are abandoned, banished or born in exile bear a physical mark of nobility, such as Lion’s birthmark of the cross in Lion de Bourges or an intense light beam emitted from the mouth of the sleeping Havelok in <em>Havelok the Dane</em>. This child’s mark is left obscure, but the line plays on the fact that despite Emaré/Egaré’s exile and apparent lowliness, her son inherits two noble bloodlines, one through his father and one through his mother.</p>

<p><i>Line 529:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>she</i> to <i>he</i>, p. 200.</p>

<p><i>Line 571:</i> <i>gode men</i> and <i>ylle</i> is repeatedly used to emphasize that everybody participates in certain actions.</p>

<p><i>Line 584:</i> Rickert notes, “After t in MS., a small round blot, which does not seem to be intended for an e,” p. 19, note 2.</p>

<p><i>Line 593:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>drynke</i> to <i>drynking</i>, p. 202.</p>

<p><i>Line 594:</i> See note to l. 360.</p>

<p><i>Line 632:</i> As long as Emaré’s true status is not revealed or reinstated, the choice made by the King of Galys to marry her appears poor.</p>

<p><i>Line 684:</i> Laskaya and Salisbury gloss “Accursed be such bad luck” and note “chawnses ylle. M[ills, ed.] glosses as ‘tribulations,’ which is perhaps best.” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#684.</p>

<p><i>Line 685:</i> Laskaya and Salisbury note “MS: dw led. A blemish in the MS obliterates the ‘el.’” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#685. The blemish is not rendered in White’s transcription.</p>

<p><i>Line 730:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>shewed</i> to <i>sewed</i>, p. 206.</p>

<p><i>Line 730:</i> Silkwork is fine needlework using the most precious materials, such as silken fabrics and threads, gold threads, pearls, gold and silver plates, and gemstones. It denotes the process and the product of sewing and embroidery using these materials.</p>

<p><i>Line 779:</i> <i>he sayde</i> translates as “he” or “they”; “they” is inferred from the context.</p>

<p><i>Line 780:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>the</i> to <i>they</i>, p. 207.</p>

<p><i>Line 792:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>Lor</i> to <i>Lord</i>, p. 207.</p>

<p><i>Line 804:</i> Rickert notes that the MS has town between Castelle and towre, “with a dotted line beneath them to signify erasure,” p. 25, note 4; White’s transcription reads “Castell town et towre et towne”, p. 335 (f.75va).</p>

<p><i>Line 810:</i> <i>cler</i> denotes beauty, but also light-reflecting qualities (radiance, shine, hue), magnificence, and excellence/ praiseworthiness, all of which would also fit. See https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED7975/track?counter=3&amp;search_id=20439830.</p>

<p><i>Line 838:</i> The MS repeats l. 837, “That most ys of powste,” following l. 839, crossed out.

<p><i>Line 847:</i> The Middle English <i>palle</i> could also indicate a purple or deep red silk, a dye reserved for emperors and significant liturgical vestments.</p>

<p><i>Line 866:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>Mentrelles</i> to <i>Menstrelles</i>, p. 209.</p>

<p><i>Line 896:</i> The MS reads <i>Yyf me þs lytyll chylde body</i>, crossing out <i>chylde</i> between <i>lytyll</i> and <i>body</i>.

<p><i>Line 904:</i> Laskaya and Salisbury note: “ grete ende. The meaning of the phrase is obscure. R[ickert] notes: ‘The ‘great end’ of the hand would naturally be the thumb (see also Italian dito grosso, Catalan dit gros, English great toe)’ (p. 46). G[ough, ed.], F[rench] &amp; H[ale, ed.], and M[ills, ed.] read grece ende. G[ough, ed.] glosses grece as stairs (from OF gres), thus, according to R[ickert, ed.], ‘top of the stairs.’ F[rench] &amp; H[ale, ed.] gloss as ‘foot of the (dais) steps,’ and M[ills, ed.] as ‘foot of the steps.’ Ru[mble] reads grete end and observes: ‘possibly what is intended is the hall or stairway, leading from the central part of the building to the sleeping chambers, the ‘great end’ being that end nearest the central rooms’ (p. 128).” See https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#905 and https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#917.</p>

<p><i>Line 916:</i> See note to l. 904.</p>

<p><i>Line 923:</i> Whiteness is often equated with beauty and luminosity. This might be an expression to convey that Emaré’s face is white.</p>

<p><i>Line 942:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>wat</i> to <i>that</i>, p. 211.</p>

<p><i>Line 944:</i> White’s diplomatic transcription indicates that the page ends after this line, beneath which <i>Explicit Emare</i> is inserted, p. 336 (f. 76rb). Ritson does not print the explicit here or at the end of the poem. No other editions note that the explicit is in the place indicated by White.</p>

<p><i>Line 949:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>Wax</i> to <i>waxen</i>, p. 211.</p>

<p><i>Line 967:</i> Ritson emends the MS’s <i>non</i> to <i>nan</i>, p. 212.</p>

<p><i>Line 988:</i> The MS reads <i>A</i>. Ritson does not indicate his emendation. Laskaya and Salisbury gloss “he” and note that “R[itson, ed.] and G[ough, ed.] both emend <i>A</i> to <i>And</i>. R[ickert, ed.], Ru[mble, ed.] and M[ills, ed.] gloss the <i>A</i> as ‘he.’” https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#989.</p>

<p><i>Line:</i> 1023 Ritson reads the MS as <i>Egramour</i> and emends to <i>Segramour</i>, p. 213; Rickert as well as Laskaya and Salisbury read the MS as <i>egramour</i> which they emend to <i>Segramour</i>. White’s transcription reads <i>segramour</i>, p. 337 (f. 76vb).</p>

<p><i>Line 1031:</i> “Complaint of Egaré.” <i>Emaré</i> thus inserts itself into two generic traditions: the complaint/plaint is a type of first-person elegiac poetry lamenting misfortune and injustice; the (Middle English) Breton lay (l. 1030) is a novelistic type of poetry relating short tales of love and adventure of “Breton” (insular Celtic) heritage or subject matter, e.g. elements of the fairy world, or the Arthurian marvellous. In fact, <i>Emaré</i> belongs to a large group of transcultually circulating tales that share the same basic plot structure. Their origin cannot be pinpointed (see Introduction). The reasons for its self-insertion into two other generic traditions are up for interpretation.</p>

<p><i>Line 1032:</i> White’s transcription reads <i>Jħu</i>, p. 337 (f. 76vb). On variant spelling across editions, see Laskaya and Salisbury’s note on l. 1033. https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/laskaya-and-salisbury-middle-english-breton-lays-emare#1033.</p>
