<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>The Middle Irish poem “Tuán mac Cairill—it was heard” tells the story of Tuán mac Cairill, a legendary figure said to have lived throughout the ages in the form of a human, stag, boar, bird and salmon. In this final form, he is eaten by the wife of an Irish king named Cairell, which causes her to become pregnant. She then gives birth to Tuán in the form of a man once again.</p>

<p>The poem comes down to us as a semi-independent text which was added after “The Story of Tuán mac Cairill to Finnen of Mag Bile” (Scél Tuáin meic Cairill do Finnen Maige Bile) in two medieval manuscripts: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 512 [s. xv - s. svi], f. 98vb, and The Book of Fermoy (Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 23 E 29, pp. 17-216. As we see at the end of the poem, Tuán’s story is embedded in a frame narrative: Tuán has been conversing with Saint Finnian, describing how he has spent hundreds of years in different animal forms.</p>

<p>A version of the story of Tuán was also inserted into the third recension (Recension C) of Lebor Gabála Érenn (literally, “The Book of the Taking of Ireland”), also known as “The Book of Invasions.” This pseudo-historical work was a medieval fabrication compiled from various biblical, classical, and native Irish sources, as well as more recent medieval material. These were woven together into a decidedly un-historical narrative which purports to recount five successive “invasions” of Ireland, from the time of Noah onwards. The purpose of the text was to provide the people of Ireland with a biblical origin, including them in the medieval Christian milieu. It therefore includes a flood event, as well as a variety of rather fantastical invasion myths, during which various features of the land were created, and cultural skills and institutions founded.</p>

<p>The theme of humans transforming into animal forms occurs in a number of early Irish and medieval Welsh narratives. In some stories, it is clear that the human beings are not just changing shape temporarily due to magical intervention, but are being ‘reborn’ in either human or animal form. It is interesting to note that several accounts by early classical authors mention that Celtic-speaking population groups in Gaul believed in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul. While it would be difficult to prove any kind of direct connection or continuity, the fairly widespread existence of related themes in ethnographic reports and literary sources is at least worthy of note.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Source</h2>
<p>“Tuán mac Cairill—it was heard” is found in five separate manuscript sources. These include an early 15th-century vellum manuscript known as The Book of Lecan (Dublin, RIA, MS 535, f. 275, 23 P 2); a 14th- to 15th-century vellum manuscript known as The Book of Ballymote (Dublin, RIA, MS 536, p. 25); a 15th- to early 16th-century parchment manuscript known as Dublin, RIA, MS. Rawlinson B. 512 (f. 98vb); an 18th-century paper manuscript by scribe Aodh Ó Dálaigh (Dublin, RIA, MS 619, p. 41); and a 19th-century paper manuscript by scribe Joseph O’ Longan (Dublin, RIA, MS 803, p. 181).</p>
<h2>About this Edition</h2>
<p>The digital edition presented here is adapted from the 1901 edition of Dublin, RIA, MS Rawlinson B. 512 by Kuno Meyer (see “Further Reading” below). A portion of the poem was edited by R.A.S. Macalister in 1939, accompanied by a preliminary translation of some stanzas. The remainder of the poem has remained untranslated and, as with many late 19th-century and early 20th-century materials, has been in need of a new translation.</p>
