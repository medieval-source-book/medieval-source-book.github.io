    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This poem by Maphrian Mor Gregorios Bar ‘Ebroyo (1226-1286) is from a collection of his poems ( musḥotho ) compiled by Mor Philoxenos Yuhanon Dolabani in 1929 and republished by the Mor Ephrem Monastery in Glane, Holland in 1983. Bar ‘Ebroyo (also latinized as Bar Hebraeus) was a prolific author who wrote on topics ranging from astronomy, medicine, theology, poetry, grammar, canon law, and more. He wrote in Arabic and Syriac and many of his works are translations of earlier Arabic works, or at least rely heavily upon such works. As maphrian, Bar ‘Ebroyo oversaw the eastern half of the Syriac Orthodox Church, with his seat being in the Mor Matay Monastery, near Mosul, Iraq. This office was second only to the patriarch of Antioch, although in function the two were largely equal. \n The title of this poem implies that the month of April ( nisan , in Syriac) is the subject of the author’s praise, yet the rose is really the recipient of the panegyric. The author seems to be alluding to the popular Arabic genre of the disputation poem, where two or more inanimate objects, animals, or even abstract concepts are an- thropomorphized and debate their qualities. The rose and narcissus (daffodil) flowers were common interlocutors in such poems. In this poem, the rose is heralded as the most beautiful of all flowers but is scolded by the narrator because it allows its beauty to be plucked and used by disreputable people. The Syriac text uses a 12-syllable meter with stanzas of four lines. \n Introduction to the Source \n Bar ‘Ebroyo’s poetry is largely undated, and relatively little has been written about it, although he wrote over 300 poems on topics as diverse as those found in his prose corpus. His poetry exists in several manuscripts, but there has been no critical edition published that includes an apparatus and discussion of the manuscripts. Two collections have been published, the one I have used for this poem (Dolabani) and an earlier one by Augustinus Scebabi (1877). In Dolabani’s collection, the poems are grouped by subject, and this poem is the first a section that focuses on the theme of nature. \n About this Edition \n I have maintained the lines and stanzas in this poem but have not preserved the meter, so as to better follow the literal meaning of the Syriac. The original Syriac is rhymed, but this was not preserved either. I have translated the month  nisan  into April, rather than transliterating it, for the sake of clarity, although it may not have exactly corresponded to the modern Gregorian month. \n Further Reading \n Bar ‘Ebroyo.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Written by Portuguese historian and civil servant João de Barros (c. 1496-1570), the  Decades of Asia  (1552–1615) is a four-volume history, one of the earliest and most monumental accounts of Portuguese colonial endeavors. Barros wrote the  Decades  while he was serving as the factor (financial administrator) of the Casa da India e Mina (House of India and Mines) (1533–67), an appointment he obtained a few years after he returned from working in West Africa. The first three volumes cover the period until 1539, and were published in 1552, 1553, and 1563. Although Barros started working on the last volume, it was only published posthumously in 1615. The fourth volume was finished by Diogo do Couto, who was at the time the royal archivist of Portugal’s official archive in India and who continued Barros’s gargantuan project of writing a comprehensive history of Portuguese colonialism. \n The excerpt translated here—Chapter 1 of the  Decades , which works like an introduction—offers a glimpse of how Barros frames the history of Portuguese colonial efforts as part of a much longer struggle between Christians and Muslims, both in the Iberian Peninsula and elsewhere. In this regard, the  Decades  is similar to other Portuguese chronicles from the medieval and early modern periods: although it has a specific subject matter—in this case, Portugal’s colonial enterprise in Africa and Asia—the history spans a longer period, connecting the subject matter to other events which Barros thought were relevant for his audience to understand Portugal’s maritime expansion. In particular, his choice to begin his history of Portuguese colonialism with the emergence of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula has very important rhetorical consequences as it justifies Portugal’s colonial expansion as a response to what he saw as an invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by Muslim kingdoms. \n By beginning his history with the emergence of Islam and with the events that led to a substantial Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, Barros frames the  Decades  and the whole project of Portuguese colonialist expansion as a religious conflict between Christianity and Islam. As a Christian historian, Barros attempts to insert such events into a broader Christian framework, according to which the Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula (the area that is now Spain and Portugal) was God’s intended punishment for heresies adopted by the local peoples (when Barros refers to “Spain” during periods that precede the creation of Portugal, he most likely means  Hispania , the Roman name given to the entire Iberian Peninsula). \n It is noteworthy that most of Barros’s narrative of Muslim expansion focuses on the Middle East and North Africa, and not on the Iberian Peninsula. Particularly intriguing is how he omits any mention of Al-Andalus—the part of the Iberian Peninsula ruled by Muslims between 711 and 1492—and how he glosses over both the Caliphate of Cordoba, a successful Muslim state in the Iberian Peninsula, and the thriving Muslim states that formed after the Caliphate’s collapse. In sum, Barros’s selection of events in his inaugural chapter—from the very first sentence—offers an image of multiple Muslim- ruled regions in Asia and Africa that represented a historical and constant Muslim threat, all the way up to the closest point to the Iberian Peninsula, conquered by an expansionist leader and his descendants. \n Although the first chapter of the  Decades  focuses on the religious conflict between Christianity and Islam by painting Muslims as conquerors—a kind of rival empire to the Christian Portuguese one—this framing of events actually transcends \n the specific conflict between Christians and Muslims. In other words, Barros sets the stage for a broader narrative of Christian expansion that he will expand on in later parts of the work, including the same theme of religious conflict but against other beliefs and customs, such as in India. He goes as far as to claim that the royal house of Portugal, which was created during the  Reconquista  (the name given to the many wars waged by Iberian Christian kingdoms against Muslim states in the Peninsula) was founded with the blood of martyrs and expanded by martyrs across all regions of the world. According to Barros’s frame, it is almost as if the events surrounding the founding of the Portuguese kingdom have endowed it with the moral duty to expanding Christianity throughout the universe. \n After making such claims about Portugal’s higher purpose, he then considers a more pragmatic issue: Portugal was only a sliver of European territory and most of the Iberian Peninsula belonged to Castile, so Barros hints that Portuguese maritime expansion was the only option left for Portugal to grow as a kingdom. In fact, Portugal’s colonialist expansion, according to Barros, mirrors Rome’s expansion onto North Africa, implying that the legacy of the Roman empire rested with Portugal in the si..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This Old Irish prayer comes from an early Irish text known as the “Litany of Creation,” which is preserved in a single manuscript. The “Litany of Creation” is comprised of two distinct sections. The first consists of numerous entreaties to God, the Trinity and Saint Michael, and makes reference to various aspects of Creation. The second section, which is presented here, includes prayers and entreaties related to elements of the created world. It refers to a life of religious devotion aided by the powers of this prayer, which is referred to as a “Besom (or Broom) of Devotion.” The lines of the prayer describe its own powerful attributes, such as connection with and communication with the divine, spiritual comfort, beauty and awe, as well as the many forms of assistance and protection bestowed upon a person as a result of its recitation. \n The image of the broom appears in several medieval Irish literary contexts. In the Life of St. Molua of Clonfertmulloe (d. circa 609), St. Molua states that unless a person has confessed their sins, they cannot obtain pardon from the Lord; for just as the floor of a house is cleaned daily with a broom, so too does the soul require the daily confession of sins in order to be made clean. The association of the broom with the cleansing of the soul is found elsewhere in the Christian literature of the Middle Ages, including the work of Theodulf of Orléans (d. 821), Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153) and Peter Cantor (d. circa 1197). \n The symbol of the besom or broom was also mentioned by the prominent Irish scholar Colcu Ua Duinechda of Clonmacnoise (d. circa 795), who is credited with writing two litanies with similarities to our own. The earliest surviving manuscript which contains them was produced around 1400, in the codex now known as the Yellow Book of Lecan (Dublin TCD 1318). From this, we can discern that the image of the “besom of devotion” played a part in a number of early Irish manuscripts, including our intriguing text. \n Introduction to the Source \n The “Litany of Creation” is preserved in Dublin RIA Manuscript 23 N 10 (formerly Betham 145, Catalog 967). This manuscript was produced by three principal scribes, who signed their names simply as Aodh, Dubthach and Torna. They worked for or belonged to the Ó Maoil Chonaire, a family of professional poets and historians from Connacht. At a conference at the Royal Irish Academy in 2019, this manuscript was given a new name by scholars: the Book of Ballycummin ( Baile in Chuimine ). \n About this Edition \n The Old Irish orthography of the poem has been standardized to assist students and researchers in disciplines outside of Celtic Studies. \n Further Reading \n Meyer, Kuno ed., “Stories and songs from Irish manuscripts: VI.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This text is an excerpt from the second redaction of the  Hellenic and Roman Chronicle , a historiographic text which was most likely completed in Rus’ in the first half of the 15th century CE (before 1453). It is one of the surviving examples of medieval Rus’ historiography and belongs to a genre known as “chronographs”. Chronographs are texts compiled from other works which contain an exposition of world history starting from the creation of the world. Such texts drew on the example of Byzantine chronicles known in Church Slavic translations (including those of John Malalas and George the Monk, known as Hamartolus) as well as on native accounts. Unfortunately, we do not know anything about the authors of the  Hellenic and Roman Chronicle . \n The  Hellenic and Roman Chronicle  opens with an extensive summary of Old Testament events and a description of the conquests of Alexander of Macedon (a.k.a. Alexander the Great). The authors devote considerable space to the history of Rome, outlining how the city on the Tiber was founded and tracing the era when it was ruled by kings, the subsequent period of the republic, and finally the period of empire. The authors were apparently also interested in the history of the so-called “Christian Empire”, whose capital was Constantinople. (The founding of the city is associated with the reign of Constantine the Great (306–337 CE), the first Roman ruler to embrace Christianity.) The  Hellenic and Roman Chron- icle  also contains a fairly systematic history of Byzantium, covering the period until the reign of Romanus I Lecapenus (919–944), who was a contemporary of the Kiev Prince Igor (912–945). The authors were apparently interested not only in political issues, but also in the history of the Church and of heterodox movements within Christianity. We can infer this from the way that their historical narrative is interwoven with fragments of polemical works. These include anti-heretical works, such as an abridged version of the  History of Paulicians  by Peter of Sicily, and anti-Muslim writings, such as the ex- cerpt translated here. The  Hellenic and Roman Chronicle  is significant because it shows how Orthodox Slavs in the Middle Ages were thinking far beyond their own horizons, demonstrating their extensive historical knowledge and their interest in different peoples, cultures, and religions. This text is practically unknown outside of a narrow circle of specialists, and it has not been translated in its entirety into any modern language. \n Introduction to the Source \n Manuscript РГБ, 228.162 was produced in Rus’ in 1485. It is one of the earliest surviving complete copies of the  Hellenic and Roman Chronicle . Besides this manuscript, there are a dozen or so complete and fragmentary copies of this work: 5 of them come from the end of the 15th century, 8 from the 16th century, and 2 from the first half of the 17th century. This indicates that the chronicle was quite popular in medieval and early modern Rus’. Manuscript РГБ, 228.162 was previous- ly in the possession of Dmitri V. Piskariov (1797–1865); it was transferred in 1868 to the Rumyantsev Museum in Moscow and then, in 1924, upon the liquidation of the museum, it was transferred to the Manuscript Department of the Russian State Library in Moscow, where it is kept to this day. \n About this Edition \n Manuscript РГБ, 228.162 is the basis for this edition of the Old Rus’ text and its English translation. The Old Rus’ text was rendered as close to the original as possible, taking into account the division into lines which is present in the manuscript. The abbreviations used in the original have been preserved. The Cyrillic script has only been simplified where necessary due to the nature of modern Cyrillic fonts. In the English translation, all additions and explanations \n by the translator are placed in square brackets. Italics indicate where vulgarisms present in the Old Rus’ original have been replaced with more semantically neutral phrases. In one instance, indicated in the notes, italics indicate that the meaning of the original text is uncertain. \n Further Reading \n Летописец Еллинский и Римский, vol. I, Текст , ed. О.В.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and import- ant humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe. \n Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe. \n Through his texts we also meet a very polemical man, who seems to get into fights with many of his contemporar- ies, the most famous of which is his conflict with another of the humanist greats, Lorenzo Valla. The collections of jokes and stories known today as the  Facetiae , but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as  Conversations  ( Confabulationes ), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his  Facetiae  are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The  Facetiae  as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the  Facetiae , Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s  The Hermaphrodite , which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punch- line seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader). \n In this conclusion to his  Facetiae,  Poggio reminisces about the context in which the  Facetiae  came to be . \n Introduction to the Source \n The  Facetiae  seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The  Facetiae  was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or ‘conversations’ were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (to Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the  Facetiae  seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages. \n About this Edition \n The translation is based on the text as it appears in the Basel 1538 edition of Poggio’s collected work available on Google Books, with a slight update to punctuation and orthography (for instance, ij is represented as ii). No emen- dations or other corrections have been made by the translator. Older versions of the text contain a few variants and some obvious errors, but in general the tradition seems quite stable (see, for example, an early print from 1471; or the fifteenth-century manuscript in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Latin 8770A). \n Further Reading \n Kallendorf, Craig. “Poggio Bracciolini” in  Oxford Bibliographies .

The collections of jokes and stories known today as the  Facetiae , but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as  Conversations  ( Confabulationes ), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his  Facetiae  are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition.

The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the  Facetiae , Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s  The Hermaphrodite , which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punch- line seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader). \n This is one of three jokes in the  Facetiae  that hinge on Dante Alighieri’s quick wit. \n Introduction to the Source \n The  Facetiae  seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The  Facetiae  was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or ‘conversations’ were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (to Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the  Facetiae  seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages. \n About this Edition \n The translation is based on the text as it appears in the Basel 1538 edition of Poggio’s collected work available on Google Books, with a slight update to punctuation and orthography (for instance, ij is represented as ii). No emen- dations or other corrections have been made by the translator.

    "title": "The Burial of Arthur | Claddedigaeth Arthur\n",
    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This text is an adaptation into Middle Welsh prose of Gerald of Wales’s report of the discovery and public exhumation of Arthur and Guinevere’s graves at Glastonbury in 1190 or 1191 and the subsequent reburial of their bones in a marble tomb. Historians have interpreted this event as a ploy by Henry II of England to crush Welsh belief in Arthur’s messianic return, a belief Gerald disparages in his account of the event. \n Gerald’s full account of the exhumation is in  Speculum Ecclesiae  ii.8–10 with an abridged version in  De principis instructione \n i.20. The Welsh text uses both as sources. The text contains the characteristic elements of Welsh “prose translation style” defined by Brynley Roberts, typical of the numerous texts translated from Latin into Middle Welsh. These features include introducing a subordinate clause with the construction  pan yw , the perfective particle  ry , and rendering  Notandum est  (“it is observed”) as  Bit honneit . The Welsh translator/adaptor does not however imitate the ornate Latin style that Gerald adopts when describing a monk being led astray by Guinevere’s beautiful hair; instead the translator simplifies and abbreviates the passage’s periodic style. \n The earliest manuscript, Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, Llanstephan 4, c.1400, which contains saints’ lives, fables, and translations of  Visio Pauli  and  St Patrick’s Purgatory , places the text in a milieu of popular adaptations of Latin and French texts into Middle Welsh in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, including the Vulgate Grail cycle, the Charlemagne cycle, Geoffrey of Monmouth’s  De gestis Britonum , and Honorius Augustodunensis’s  Imago mundi . The manuscript shares a scribe with the  Red Book of Hergest , a large compendium of Middle Welsh prose and poetry created under the patronage of Welsh nobleman Hopcyn ap Tomos, linking it to a literary renaissance in South Wales spurred by the interests of post-conquest Welsh nobility. The translation is therefore secular, non-monastic, professional, and intended for a lay audience. \n This text constitutes a rare example of the reception of Gerald of Wales’s writing in Wales. Both  De principis instructione  and  Speculum ecclesiae  survive in one manuscript each, leaving behind little information about patterns of wider circulation. One can only speculate about whether they were commonly known in Wales. However, there is circumstantial evidence that the manuscript of  Speculum ecclesiae  came from Llanthony Secunda Priory in Gloucestershire, offering a point of entry into Wales. The Welsh text cites  Drych yr Eglwys  (“Mirror of Princes”) as a source, indicating the translator knew the Latin source by name. External accounts of the exhumation of Arthur’s bones are also found in chronicles including  Higden’s Polychronicon , the Annals of Margam, and Ralph of Coggeshall’s  Chronicon Anglicanum , indicating that the story of Arthur’s grave was available to Welsh scribes in several forms. \n Though the event may have been staged as a propaganda piece intended to quash Welsh belief in Arthur’s return, its translation into Welsh c.1400 suggests continued interest in the exhumation as antiquarian or legendary history. In fact, there was sustained interest into the fifteenth century in Arthur’s tomb at Glastonbury, as others have discussed, indicating continued symbolic relevance of Arthur as a figure of political unity and dominance. Edward I had the bones translated from the lady chapel to the high altar in 1278 and Edward III came to Glastonbury to visit the tomb in 1331. James Carley argues that Henry V staged another excavation in the 1420s, indicated by a letter to the abbot inquiring about new archaeological finds. It is tempting to associate interest in Arthur’s messianic return with the rebellion of Owain Glyn Dŵr taking place around the time the manuscript was made. Ongoing use of political prophecies to influence opinion about \n Owain Glyn Dŵr attests to the continued importance in the early fifteenth century of the idea of a messianic savior, or  mab darogan  “son of prophecy,” predicted to deliver the Welsh from English oppression. However, it is not certain whether this text had perceived prophetic or historical value for the manuscript’s compilers. Without putting too fine a point on generic differences in Middle Welsh writing, the contents of Llanstephan 4 could suggest that  Claddedigaeth Arthur  was associated with visionary, religious, and moralizing works rather than prophecy or history. \n Introduction to the Source \n This edition is a transcription from Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, Llanstephan 4, c.1400, ff. 505r-509r, the earliest witness to Version A of the text. Llanstephan 4 was originally part of a composite owned by Edward Lhuyd called  Didrefn Gasgliad  (“haphazard miscellany”) that was split up into the first four Llanstephan manuscripts, now in the National Library of Wales.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This poem is a  serranilla , an evolution of the Provençal  pastorela . Written in short verse ( arte menor ),  serranillas  narrate a courtly poet’s encounter with a mountain woman. This is one of six compositions in the genre by fifteenth-century author Carvajal (or Carvajales). Very little is known about Carvajal’s life. His poetry is linked to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples (r. 1442-1458) and to that of Alfonso’s son Ferrante (r. 1459-1494). In addition to his famous  serranillas , Carvajal is also known for his literary epistles and ballads. \n In this poem, Carvajal subverts some of the genre’s conventions, as he does not meet a  serrana  but a lady of the court—the Princess of Rossano—in the context in which he would have normally run into a rustic woman. Upon encountering the lady, the poet ponders her beauty with references to biblical and mythological characters. \n Introduction to the Source \n The poem is copied in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España, VITR/17/7, fol. 136v-137r. This manuscript is a copy of the poetry collection known as the  Cancionero de Estúñiga  , ca. 1465. It has been digitized:  http://bdh-rd.bne.es/view- er.vm?id=0000051837. It contains a compilation of mostly Castilian poems, including ballads, as well as a few Italian compositions. Their authors accompanied the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous, in Naples in the mid-fifteenth century. \n About this Edition \n The text has been punctuated.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The  Dialogus Creaturarum  (‘Dialogue of Creatures’), of which this text is one of eight published by the  Global Medieval Sourcebook , was composed in the fourteenth century. Its authorship remains debated, though it was historically attributed to either Nicolaus Pergamenus, about whom little is known, or Magninus Mediolanensis (also known as Mayno de Mayneriis), who was a physician. In recent years, beginning with Pierre Ruelle in 1985, scholars have tended towards the conclusion that the  Dialogus  was compiled in Milan, though not necessarily by Magninus. \n The text consists of 122 dialogues largely populated by anthropomorphic ‘creatures’, loosely defined; sections translated for the  Global Medieval Sourcebook  feature elements (fire, water), planetary bodies (the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, a cloud), animals (the leopard and unicorn), as well as a talking topaz. Each dialogue is further divided into two sections, the first part depicting an encounter between these creatures—two is the usual number, though some dialogues have one or three—that ends in a violent conflict. This experience is summed up in a moral, typically delivered by the defeated party, which is then exemplified in the second half of the dialogue through citations from historiography, literature, and sacred scripture. Common texts cited include the pagan authors Seneca the Younger and Valerius Maximus, along with the Christian writers Paul, Augustine, and John Chrysostom and compilations such as the  Vitae patrum  (‘Lives of the Fathers’) and  Legenda aurea  (‘Golden Legend’). \n The great precision with which these references are cited—often including book and chapter numbers—suggests that the  Dialogus  was designed as a reference text containing recommendations for further reading, and more specifically as a handbook for ‘constructing sermons’ (as indicated in the Preface). This purpose does not, however, detract from its entertaining style, which derives in no small part from the passionate dialogue that takes place between the ‘creatures’ and the fast-paced descriptions of their battles against one another. These features explain the popularity of the  Dialogus , which ran through numerous editions from the late fifteenth century onwards. The illustrated text compiled by Gerard Leeu was printed eight times in the eleven years from 1480 to 1491, once in French, twice in Dutch, and five times in Latin. \n Introduction to the Source \n Two manuscript versions of the  Dialogus Creaturarum  exist. Of these, only the so-called ‘short redaction’ has been printed. Gerard Leeu opted for this version of the text in the first Latin edition (1480), and all the vernacular translations are based upon it. The ‘short redaction’ is attested in twelve manuscripts from the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and is thought to best reflect the original text, which was composed after 1326. This dating derives from the fact that it borrows heavily from a compilation, the  Libellus qui intitulatur multifarium , which was compiled at Bologna in that year (see Ruelle 1985, p. 22).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The  Dialogus Creaturarum  (‘Dialogue of Creatures’), of which this text is one of eight published by the  Global Medieval Sourcebook , was composed in the fourteenth century. Its authorship remains debated, though it was historically attributed to either Nicolaus Pergamenus, about whom little is known, or Magninus Mediolanensis (also known as Mayno de Mayneriis), who was a physician. In recent years, beginning with Pierre Ruelle in 1985, scholars have tended towards the conclusion that the  Dialogus  was compiled in Milan, though not necessarily by Magninus. \n The text consists of 122 dialogues largely populated by anthropomorphic ‘creatures’, loosely defined; sections translated for the  Global Medieval Sourcebook  feature elements (fire, water), planetary bodies (the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, a cloud), animals (the leopard and unicorn), as well as a talking topaz. Each dialogue is further divided into two sections, the first part depicting an encounter between these creatures—two is the usual number, though some dialogues have one or three—that ends in a violent conflict. This experience is summed up in a moral, typically delivered by the defeated party, which is then exemplified in the second half of the dialogue through citations from historiography, literature, and sacred scripture. Common texts cited include the pagan authors Seneca the Younger and Valerius Maximus, along with the Christian writers Paul, Augustine, and John Chrysostom and compilations such as the  Vitae patrum  (‘Lives of the Fathers’) and  Legenda aurea  (‘Golden Legend’). \n The great precision with which these references are cited—often including book and chapter numbers—suggests that the  Dialogus  was designed as a reference text containing recommendations for further reading, and more specifically as a handbook for ‘constructing sermons’ (as indicated in the Preface). This purpose does not, however, detract from its entertaining style, which derives in no small part from the passionate dialogue that takes place between the ‘creatures’ and the fast-paced descriptions of their battles against one another. These features explain the popularity of the  Dialogus , which ran through numerous editions from the late fifteenth century onwards. The illustrated text compiled by Gerard Leeu was printed eight times in the eleven years from 1480 to 1491, once in French, twice in Dutch, and five times in Latin. \n Introduction to the Source \n Two manuscript versions of the  Dialogus Creaturarum  exist. Of these, only the so-called ‘short redaction’ has been printed. Gerard Leeu opted for this version of the text in the first Latin edition (1480), and all the vernacular translations are based upon it. The ‘short redaction’ is attested in twelve manuscripts from the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and is thought to best reflect the original text, which was composed after 1326. This dating derives from the fact that it borrows heavily from a compilation, the  Libellus qui intitulatur multifarium , which was compiled at Bologna in that year (see Ruelle 1985, p. 22).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Eifuku Mon’in (1271-1342), or Ex-empress Eifuku (also known as Saionji Kyōko), was born into the noble Saionji family. Along with her husband, Emperor Fushimi (1265-1317), she would prove to be one of the most important leaders in the development of  waka  poetry in the late Kamakura (1185-1333) and Nanbokuchō periods (1336-1392). The term  waka  (meaning literally “Japanese poem”) once described a variety of sub-forms of Japanese poetry, but by the time Eifuku Mon’in was writing, it had come to primarily signify the sub-form  tanka , which consists of sylla- bles in a pattern of 5-7-5-7-7. \n The  waka  in the  Global Medieval Sourcebook  are all by Eifuku Mon’in and are taken from the “Love” sections of the  Fūga wakashū  (c. 1344-1346), an anthology of  waka  from various poets commissioned by Emperor Hanazono. The periodic commissioning of imperial poetry anthologies (or  chokusen wakashū ) was an important element in the de- velopment of a poetic canon in premodern Japan. Each anthology was organized into sections related to a specific topic, such as “Spring,” “Travel,” “Winter,” or “Love.” \n These  waka  give us insight into how deeply medieval Japanese poetry was tied to the public, political world, as well as how women found ways to participate in that public world.  Waka  in the aristocratic court had come to be dom- inated by the Nijō school, which advocated for a conservative approach to poetry. In the 1270s, sister and brother Kyōgoku Tameko and Tamekane trail-blazed a new style of writing  waka , a style shorn of the rhetorical and allusive flourishes characteristic of Nijō writing in favor of more direct, even conversational, expressions of feeling. A poet- ry group known as the Kyōgoku school grew around this style. The two siblings became Emperor Fushimi’s tutors in 1280, forever cementing the bond between the Kyōgoku school and Fushimi’s side of the imperial family, the Jimyōin line. This line was one half of a struggle between two branches of the imperial family claiming the throne; thus, the prestige of the Kyōgoku school and the presence of their poems in the imperial poetry anthologies would rise and fall with the fate of the Jimyōin emperors. \n Eifuku Mon’in, having married into the this imperial line, found herself the defender of both the Jimyōin line and the Kyōgoku school after its earlier members, including her husband, had died or been exiled. By personally training a large number of future emperors and empresses, noblemen and noblewomen, Eifuku Mon’in led the Kyōgoku school and secured its legacy, all while producing some of the best poetry of the period. The indispensability of her leader- ship for the Kyōgoku school is attested by her being the poet with the second highest number of poems in the  Fūga wakashū , the highest number reserved for the Fushimi out of traditional reverence for the emperor. \n Poem 1077 features a female speaker proclaiming a strong desire to see her lover again, using the trope of “awaiting her man who has left.” It is unusual to see this type of female speaker so early on in the love books of poetry anthologies (in Book 2 out of 5), since she usually would still be rebuffing his advances out of modesty at this stage, according to waka convention. Here, Eifuku Mon’in’s poetic persona strikes a balance between a conventionally passive woman waiting for her lover and a woman boldly expressing desire for her lover before she is “supposed to.” \n Introduction to the Source \n The  Fūga wakashū  imperial anthology was commissioned and compiled between 1344 and 1346 by retired Em- peror Hanazono (1297-1348), the son of Eifuku Mon’in. The  Fūga wakashū  contains twenty volumes with a total of 2,210 poems. The anthology is the second and final imperial anthology to prominently feature Kyōgoku school po- etry, the first being the  Gyokuyō wakashū  (c. 1313-14). It also features many poets from the Reizei poetry school. \n It is notable that Hanazono involved himself to such an extent in the creation of the anthology. Normally, the em- peror commissioning the work would have several compilers gather the poems, arrange them into sections, and make decisions on how to transcribe the poems, after which the emperor would inspect the final draft. Hanazono was trained by his mother Eifuku in the Kyōgoku style and personally knew many of the poets included in the collection. It is unsurprising, then, that Hanazono compiled the anthology himself, not to mention his writing the Chinese and Japanese prefaces to the anthology. \n Two of the earliest surviving manuscripts of the  Fūga wakashū  date back to a time roughly contemporaneous with the compilation of the text. One is a fragment stored in Tsurumi University’s Special Collections; the other is a partial manuscript containing the seventeenth volume, which was transcribed by the Buddhist poet Ton’a, and which is stored at the Itsuō Art Museum in Ōsaka.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Eifuku Mon’in (1271-1342), or Ex-empress Eifuku (also known as Saionji Kyōko), was born into the noble Saionji family. Along with her husband, Emperor Fushimi (1265-1317), she would prove to be one of the most important leaders in the development of  waka  poetry in the late Kamakura (1185-1333) and Nanbokuchō periods (1336-1392). The term  waka  (meaning literally “Japanese poem”) once described a variety of sub-forms of Japanese poetry, but by the time Eifuku Mon’in was writing, it had come to primarily signify the sub-form  tanka , which consists of sylla- bles in a pattern of 5-7-5-7-7. \n The  waka  in the  Global Medieval Sourcebook  are all by Eifuku Mon’in and are taken from the “Love” sections of the  Fūga wakashū  (c. 1344-1346), an anthology of  waka  from various poets commissioned by Emperor Hanazono. The periodic commissioning of imperial poetry anthologies (or  chokusen wakashū ) was an important element in the de- velopment of a poetic canon in premodern Japan. Each anthology was organized into sections related to a specific topic, such as “Spring,” “Travel,” “Winter,” or “Love.” \n These  waka  give us insight into how deeply medieval Japanese poetry was tied to the public, political world, as well as how women found ways to participate in that public world.  Waka  in the aristocratic court had come to be dom- inated by the Nijō school, which advocated for a conservative approach to poetry. In the 1270s, sister and brother Kyōgoku Tameko and Tamekane trail-blazed a new style of writing  waka , a style shorn of the rhetorical and allusive flourishes characteristic of Nijō writing in favor of more direct, even conversational, expressions of feeling. A poet- ry group known as the Kyōgoku school grew around this style. The two siblings became Emperor Fushimi’s tutors in 1280, forever cementing the bond between the Kyōgoku school and Fushimi’s side of the imperial family, the Jimyōin line. This line was one half of a struggle between two branches of the imperial family claiming the throne; thus, the prestige of the Kyōgoku school and the presence of their poems in the imperial poetry anthologies would rise and fall with the fate of the Jimyōin emperors. \n Eifuku Mon’in, having married into the this imperial line, found herself the defender of both the Jimyōin line and the Kyōgoku school after its earlier members, including her husband, had died or been exiled. By personally training a large number of future emperors and empresses, noblemen and noblewomen, Eifuku Mon’in led the Kyōgoku school and secured its legacy, all while producing some of the best poetry of the period. The indispensability of her leader- ship for the Kyōgoku school is attested by her being the poet with the second highest number of poems in the  Fūga wakashū , the highest number reserved for the Fushimi out of traditional reverence for the emperor. \n Poem 1388 may be read as simply another expression of an abandoned lover’s heartache, but there is also hidden historical subtext. Eifuku had witnessed the fall of the Kamakura government, experienced the continual decline of the imperial court’s status, and outlived many members of the Jimyōin line, her own family clan the Saionji, as well as early members of the Kyōgoku school. This poem can be read as an elegy for this loss as well as a state- ment of her persistence (“clinging”) in preserving the legacy of these three groups in the last stage of her life. \n Introduction to the Source \n The  Fūga wakashū  imperial anthology was commissioned and compiled between 1344 and 1346 by retired Em- peror Hanazono (1297-1348), the son of Eifuku Mon’in. The  Fūga wakashū  contains twenty volumes with a total of 2,210 poems. The anthology is the second and final imperial anthology to prominently feature Kyōgoku school po- etry, the first being the  Gyokuyō wakashū  (c. 1313-14). It also features many poets from the Reizei poetry school. \n It is notable that Hanazono involved himself to such an extent in the creation of the anthology. Normally, the em- peror commissioning the work would have several compilers gather the poems, arrange them into sections, and make decisions on how to transcribe the poems, after which the emperor would inspect the final draft.

    "title": "Emare | Emaré\n",
    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Emaré is a 14th-century Middle English adaptation of a narrative type known as “maiden-without-hands” (AT 706), “Manekine-story,” or “Constance-saga”. It follows the misadventures of a female protagonist whom most versions characterize as royal, pious, educated, and beautiful. Refusing her father’s incestuous advances, she flees or is exiled. In exile, the local ruler wishes to marry her; many versions emphasize her otherworldly beauty. A relative or courtier does not trust the beautiful stranger. When her husband is absent for the birth of their child, the mistrustful relative or courtier intercepts a letter (or series of letters) delivering the news and replaces them with slanderous content, resulting in a second exile. Ultimately, the family reunites, in most versions in Rome, where the protagonist’s husband and father seek absolution for their sins and find the protagonist and her child (or children). \n The oldest known versions of this narrative date to the 13th century ( Vitae Offarum Duorum , insular Latin, 1250 or earlier; Mai und Beaflor , German, dated variously from 1220–80; La Manekine , French, dated variously from 1230–80), but it has been retold over centuries across languages, genre, and faith communities. Its origins and the connections between different versions cannot be established. In the (Latin) West, Maryvonne Hagby counts 41 distinct versions in medieval English, German, Latin and Romance languages (including Catalan, Spanish, French, and Italian), with manuscripts spanning from insular Britain across the European Continent to North Africa, as stand-alone romances, novellas, exempla, miracle tales, or plays, or as chronicle or romance subplots. The Global Medieval Sourcebook  contains an Aragonese version of the story found in a 16th-century Aljamiado manuscript:  http://sourcebook.stanford.edu/text/damsel_carcayciona. Emaré adapts the tale as a short, tail-rhymed narrative which identifies itself as a Breton Lay (see l. 1030). It thus associates itself with a “Celtic” or Breton story matter, to which it establishes further links by way of Arthurian character names. \n A prevalent stylistic feature of this text is its use of repetition. Another noteworthy feature is its long ekphrasis (description) of a wondrous cloth which the Sicilian King Tergaunte brings to the protagonist’s father, the Emperor Artyus. While Artyus is blinded by the rich, gem-encrusted textile, the description makes visible the embroidery and provides a biography of the object. The narrator tells us that it was worked with rare materials by the Emir of Babylon’s daughter as a love-token for the Sultan of Babylon’s son. Four panels in the cloth depict romance couples: Amadas and Ydoine, Tristan and Yseut, Floire and Blancheflur, and the Babylonian lovers themselves. It comes to Tergaunte as a spoil of war. After Tergaunte’s departure, the Emperor desires his daughter and has a wedding dress shaped from the cloth; he exiles her while she is still wearing the dress. Emaré and her son Segramour are frequently referred to as being “worthy beneath their clothing.” Narrative attention is directed to her dazzling robe at all major plot points. \n Scholarly discussion to date has often focused on the ekphrasis of the wondrous cloth, including its connection with genre, incest, the narrative’s relation to the organizing principles of Cotton Caligula Aii (the miscellany in which it was transmitted), its poetics, and its negotiation of interfaith relations. However, the text is barely acknowledged outside of English Studies and is usually aligned with more famous versions, such as Chaucer’s “Man of Law’s Tale”, Gower’s Confessio Amantis , or La Manekine . Fruitful comparisons could be made with less acclaimed versions and, more generally, Emaré could be studied from the perspective of its position within a transcultural textual network transcending modern notions of separated national literatures. \n Introduction to the Source \n The 15th-century miscellany British Library Cotton Caligula Aii contains the only extant copy of the text. While tentatively dated to the second half of the 14th century, Emaré is likely based on a lost 13th-century French text which Edith Rickert, a previous editor of the text, has linked to the crusading milieu. The miscellany includes one epic and seven romance texts alongside devotional and didactic material. While the other romances are grouped together, Emaré is inserted in the middle of a series of devotional texts. Opening with a prayer to “Jhesu that is kyng in trone” (l. 1), Emaré ’s prologue appears to continue the frequent invocations of Jesus found in the prayer which precedes it (“Jesus for your Blood”). According to Rickert, Emaré contains the longest introductory prayer of any Middle English romance. This is an indication of the narrative’s links to religious modes of writing and to the manuscript’s didactic and devotional contents. \n About this Edition \n T..."

    "textauthor": "Guillaume de Nangis",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This translated excerpt comes from Guillaume de Nangis’s  Life of St. Louis  produced near Paris around 1300 CE. Predating Louis’s more famous biography by Jean de Joinville, the chronicle celebrates the life, accomplishments and sometimes miraculous abilities of the famous king who was canonized in 1297. The version presented here recounts an episode during the French king’s final crusade, an expedition into Tunisia as part of the Eighth Crusade (1270). \n According to the text, King Louis IX had been invited to Tunisia by the “king of Tunis”—the Hafsid ruler al-Mustansir, who promised to convert to Christianity. However, upon the arrival of Louis’s forces, the Islamic leader reneges on his word. After sacking Carthage, the crusader army returns and sets up camp. Three “Saracens” (a medieval pejorative term that racialized Muslims) approach John of Acre, the butler of France, claiming that they want to convert to Christianity. Suddenly, a different, larger group of Muslims conducts a surprise attack, killing many Christians. John drags the first group before King Louis where their leader claims that he had no part in the ambush, insisting that his political rival committed this treachery. The king does not believe their story but releases them and orders the construction of defenses around the camp to prevent future assaults. The “Saracen commander” is received by his own camp with a warm welcome, suggesting that conversion was never really his intention. \n While scholars agree that al-Mustansir may have considered converting for his own political purposes, there remains discussion about how to read the relationship between the text and the image that accompanies it on Royal MS 16 G VI f.442r (see icon image; a larger resolution image can be viewed here). I have recently argued that this section of the manuscript serves as an allegory of al-Mustansir’s actions, as well as a Latin Christian polemic on the duplicity of “Saracens” writ large. It is notable that the Hafsid Muslims depicted on 440v and 442r are the only “shoeless Saracens” in the entirety of the manuscript, suggesting that illuminators wanted to cast these figures as particularly barbarous for their inadvertent role in Louis’s death. Indeed, the heraldic motifs on the “Saracen” shield further dehumanize the Muslims by affiliating them with either pigs or dogs. \n Introduction to the Source \n This version of Guillaume de Nangis’s text is included in the  Grandes Chroniques de France  made for John II of France (British Library-Royal MS 16 G VI). These royal chronicles blend historical and mythological elements, functioning as a source of political legitimacy for both the Capetian and Valois dynasties of French monarchs. \n About this Edition \n The translator has used Jules Viard’s edition of  Les Grandes Chroniques De France  for translation. The text may be found in the appendix (volume 10). \n Please note that while this text largely follows that of Royal MS 16 G VI there is some nuance in the rubric. Viard’s edition reads “Comment mesire Jehan d’Acre, bouteillier de France qui faisait le guet fu deceus d’aucuns Sarrazins qui requéraient le baptesme,” which we have translated as “How Sir John of Acre, butler of France, who was on guard, was deceived by some Saracens who requested baptism.” Wollesen has previously transcribed the rubric from Royal MS 16 G VI as “comment mesire jehan dacre bouteiller de France qui faisoit le guet daucuns sa reqroient le baptesme,” which he translates as “How Sir John of Acre, butler of France, is on the lookout for some Saracens who request to be baptized.” \n The translator would like to thank Professor Ullrich Langer of University of Wisconsin—Madison for his assistance in translating this excerpt. Furthermore, support for this research was provided by the Graduate School and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin—Madison with funding from the Kemper Knapp Bequest. Finally, the larger project of “‘Treacherous and Shoeless Saracens’: French Depictions of Hafsids in Royal MS 16 G VI,” is indebted to the mentorship of Professor Asa Simon Mittman of California State University, Chico. \n Further Reading \n Hedeman, Anne D.

Like many well-educated men in the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), Hong Mai grew up in a prominent family, passed the civil service examination, and obtained a post in the imperial government. However, due to misconduct during a diplomatic mission, his career came to an abrupt end. From then on, he retreated to his study and devoted himself to writing the  Record . \n The corpus of the  Record  originally consisted of 420 chapters. What we have today, however, is but a small fraction of the original text. The  Record  shows a remarkable degree of accuracy when we compare it with the official documents and other texts of the same period. Nevertheless, many stories in the  Record  are outright fictitious or based on highly unreliable sources. The  Record  preserved much information about the society, culture, and religion of the Southern Song Dynasty and was a source of inspiration for generations of writers after Hong Mai. Writers in late imperial China, for instance, took up many stories in the  Record  and refashioned them into stories that met the demands and expectations of their own times. \n Further Reading \n Allen, Sarah M.

In the second month of the fifth year of the Shaoxing era, some bandits emerged from the Guanying Mountain in the area and plundered many villages and counties. Wu Qi ran away. His wife and their daughter were captured and joined other women captured from the same village. Among this group of women, Wu’s wife was one of the more attractive, so one of the bandits wanted to have sex with her. Wu’s wife scolded him, saying: “People like you are nothing but bandits. The military will arrive in no time and you all will be crushed. I am from a reputable family. How can I become your woman?” The bandit tried to force her into it but failed, and then he hit her. Wu’s wife started shouting and ranting but in the end was killed by the bandit. After the bandits were suppressed, the other captured women all returned home. They said: “If Mr. Wu’s wife had not scolded the bandit, she could have returned home too.” When they described her death in great detail, Mr. Wu understood what happened. All those who heard this story praised her chastity, and I therefore write this piece to spread her fame. \n"

When his daughter-in-law died, the Chen family buried her in the mountain north of the county. Every evening, her spirit would come back home to sleep with her husband. Her husband was scared and slept in his mother’s bed. But the woman came back again and could not be turned away. Even when she saw the [other members of the] Chen family, she would not avoid them. Her son was a few years old, cute and good-looking. Every time she tried to take him away, the entire Chen family would fight to get him back. However the woman went in and out of the Chen family home like there was no one around. The Chen family was so scared that they hired a Daoist to set up a religious ceremony and pray to God on their behalf – neither [action] could dispel the spirit. At the time, it was the third month of the Shaoxing era. After three months, the magistrate Chen died in the county. \n"

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Childbirth in medieval Europe was often the most dangerous experience of a woman’s life. Because of poor hygiene and a lack of gynecological knowledge, scholars have estimated that as many as ten percent of women died during childbirth or immediately afterwards. Not only did mothers die in large numbers, but as many as thirty percent of children died in the process of childbirth. In the face of these dangers, medieval people used a wide variety of charms and prayers in an attempt to improve their chances of a successful delivery. \n The charm presented here was composed in England in the eleventh century CE and is an example of a “peperit charm”. The name comes from the Latin word  peperit  (“gave birth to”). This word occurs frequently in these charms, because they list the biblical women who gave birth to children. Indeed, a peperit charm can be identified by its sequence of holy mothers, one of the most widespread motifs in medieval childbirth charms. Typically, as is the case here, a peperit charm will invoke the names of holy mothers one by one. Some examples will contain other formulations, whether to add to the functions to the charm or to enhance its effects. This charm contains three additional features that can be found in other childbirth charms: an appeal to the unborn child to leave the womb; the account of Lazarus’s resurrection with its climac- tic words, “Lazarus, come forth!”; and instructions for how to turn the prayer into an amulet that the laboring woman can wear on her body. \n In the case of the  Junius Peperit Charm , the instructions for turning the prayer into an amulet state that the charm should be written on wax that has never been used before and bound to the woman’s right foot. The requirement for unworked wax (also known as “virgin” wax) is interesting, seeming to emphasize the sacramental quality of the prayer. The instruc- tion to attach the prayer to the pregnant woman’s body suggests that there was a hope that she could connect with its content in an embodied way, drawing on its power to support her own body during childbirth. \n In comparison to childbirth prayers, an example of which is presented in this collection, this charm has minimal narrative content, focusing instead on the invocation of biblical names. It is quite possible that this charm, or at least the first part of it, would have been repeatedly chanted during a woman’s labor. Hearing the familiar names of biblical mothers might have served to calm and encourage the laboring woman, reassuring her that she too could deliver her child safely. \n Introduction to the Source \n The  Junius Childbirth Charm  is transmitted in the manuscript Oxford Bodleian Library, MS Junius 85/86, an eleventh-cen- tury Anglo-Saxon manuscript containing Lenten sermons, including dialogues between the body and soul. It is one of four childbirth charms written into the spaces between sermons. It is worth noting that the childbirth charms in this manuscript contain the first known occurrence of the sequence of the holy mothers \n About this Edition \n This text has been transcribed from Oxford Bodleian Library MS Junius 85/86, fol. 17r. Some spellings have been standardized and errors corrected. All occurrences of the letters “u” and “v” are preserved in their original form.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Das Ludwigslied (or the Lay of Ludwig) is a historical narrative poem consisting of 59 rhyming couplets. It chroni- cles the life of Ludwig (Louis III of France), and his personal relationship with God, culminating in the victory of the Franks over the Vikings at the Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu, which took place in August of 881 CE. The poem has prominent Christian themes, and portrays God as playing an active role in human events, both sending the Vikings to punish the Franks and convincing Ludwig to lead the Frankish army against the invaders. The author of the text is unknown, but was likely a monk at the Frankish monastery of Saint-Amand, in what is now Belgium. Another text in the same manuscript was written by the same scribe in Old French, implying that he may have come from Germany and been multilingual. Ludwig died only one year after the battle chronicled in the poem, yet the poem makes no mention of his death and refers to him as though he is still alive, leading many scholars to conclude that the poem was written in the intervening year (881-882 CE). \n The poem is written in Old High German, and scholars speculate that it may be the only surviving text written in West Franconian dialect that was spoken by the Carolingian Court. It was transmitted in only one manuscript and has been of interest to scholars since its discovery in the 18th century, before it was lost and rediscovered in the 19th century, making it one of the first Old High German texts to be studied by scholars of medieval vernacular literature. \n Scholars have been fascinated by the poem’s portrayal of God, as he plays a much more active role than in most medieval Christian texts. Some have argued that his personal guardianship of Ludwig is a trace of pagan polytheism in an otherwise Christian context. \n Further Reading \n Murdoch, Brian.  Old High German Literature.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This is a melancholic  ci  which plays with the image of withering plum blossoms to evoke the passage of time and the impermanence of happiness. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of  ci  but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre. \n In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dy- nasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry. Following the invasion of Kaifeng, she moved first to Nanjing and then to Lin’an, where she spent the remaining decades of her life; her husband died in 1129. In contrast to the love themes of her earlier  ci , much of her later poetry is concerned with the sorrow of her forced migration and her personal loneliness in her new surroundings. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1. Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since  ci  poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differentiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often be deduced by the translator from context. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Li Qingzhao wrote in a note accompanying this  ci  that it was inspired by Ouyang Xiu’s “To the tune of ‘Butterfly love’”, which she greatly admired. Both  ci  have a similar theme—the speaker’s regret—and share a similar opening image of a courtyard (in Ouyang Xiu’s version: “The courtyard is deep, how many layers of depth are there?”). \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of  ci  but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre. \n In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dy- nasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry. Following the invasion of Kaifeng, she moved first to Nanjing and then to Lin’an, where she spent the remaining decades of her life; her husband died in 1129. In contrast to the love themes of her earlier  ci , much of her later poetry is concerned with the sorrow of her forced migration and her personal loneliness in her new surroundings. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1. Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since  ci  poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differentiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often be deduced by the translator from context. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

Like other  ci  which she composed, it captures the loneliness of a speaker whose feelings jar against the happy scenes around her. In this case, the mention of the festival of Double Ninth (a harvest festival associated with expressions of gratitude) emphasises her alienation.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This ci, like others by Li Qingzhao, wistfully recalls past experiences. Here the poet-speaker remembers a drunken evening and her efforts to return home by boat. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of  ci  but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre. \n In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dy- nasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry. Following the invasion of Kaifeng, she moved first to Nanjing and then to Lin’an, where she spent the remaining decades of her life; her husband died in 1129.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This is one of Li Qingzhao’s last works. She composed it when she had already moved to the south in her later life, and it captures her struggle with homesickness. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain.

The second stanza describes her intention to travel to a place where spring is still in full bloom, but also her doubts about the possibility of casting off her unhappiness.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song recounts the speaker’s chance encounter with an old lover and the rekindling of their affair. The focus on concrete details and isolated actions—the movement of an eyebrow, a slightly raised curtain—creates a sensuous atmo- sphere, conveying the intensity of their encounter. The ending suggests the speaker’s hedonistic outlook, which is typical of Liu Yong. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

After he failed  keju , the Imperial Chinese civil service examination, he wrote the song “To the tune ‘Crane Soaring in the Sky’”, in which he claimed that  ci  poets are as important as prime ministers. This led the Ren Emperor of Song 宋仁宗 to personally deem him unfit for imperial service.

The emperor went so far as to deliberately fail Liu Yong in his following attempt at the exams. \n Liu Yong’s continued output of poetry, deemed frivolous, trivial and vulgar by court officials, had a lasting impact on his professional life. He did not pass the civil service exam until he was 48 years old; before that, he spent much of his time with singers and courtesans, writing  ci  and living a hedonistic existence. After he finally passed  keju , he worked as a low rank official in several areas and sought to advance his career through the assistance of the prime minister of that time, Yan Shu, who was also a famous  ci  poet (and is featured in this collection). Yan Shu mocked the frivolity of Liu Yong’s lyr- ics and refused to assist him, and the emperor, upon learning of his attempt, commented that Liu Yong, as a  ci  composer, should stick to composing  ci . In response to the emperor’s comment, Liu Yong, in typically rebellious fashion, began sign- \n ing his  ci  “composer of  ci  by imperial decree”. He made a final attempt to salvage his career by writing a complimentary  ci  to the emperor, but this was regarded as offensive and the emperor stripped him of his official titles and stated that he would never be accepted back at court. From then on, he returned to his previous lifestyle, indulging in the company of singers and courtesans. \n Because of his unique life experience, the sentiments expressed in Liu Yong’s  ci  are often very different from the views typically expressed in Chinese society at that time, with an especially cynical attitude towards serving the empire and a pronounced defense of hedonism. Nevertheless, Liu Yong’s  ci  were extremely popular throughout the empire, giving rise to the frequently repeated observation that “if you can see a well in a place, you can hear Liu Yong’s  ci  being sung there”. As every tiny town had a well, this indicates the wide reach of Liu’s lyrics. \n Liu Yong is also notable for his many formal innovations to  ci  poetry.

Such an outlook was generally frowned upon in Imperial China, as it contravened cornerstones of Chinese culture and Confucian philosophy, including the obligation to serve the empire and the nobility of entering the political arena.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Like many of Liu Yong’s songs, this one evokes complex emotions. In the first stanza, the male speaker reflects on the past joys of his romantic relationship, culminating in his current anxieties. In the second stanza, he analyzes his lover’s communication and doubts her commitment. \n This  ci  also contains some notable allusions to other works of Chinese literature. Liu Yong alludes to Song Yu 宋玉 , a famous composer of songs and rhapsodies from the Warring States period (453–221 BCE), to whom are attributed a number of poems in the  Verses of Chu . Song Yu was known as Song Yu of the Orchid Terrace, because he once toured this terrace (presumably in current-day Hubei Province) with the Xiang King of Chu 楚襄王 and documented their conversation in a famous rhapsody, “The Rhapsody of the Wind” ( 风賦 ). \n The final two lines of Liu Yong’s ci allude to another of Song Yu’s works, the  Song of Gao Tang  ( 高唐賦 ). This song narrates a love affair between the Huai King of Chu 楚怀王 and a mountain fairy which takes place in the king’s dream; in this dream, the mountain fairy describes her residence after their lovemaking as “made from the cloud in the morning, but comprised of rain in the evening”. Both the penultimate line of Liu Yong’s  ci , and the image of the “floating cloud” to refer to a beautiful woman, come from Song Yu’s work. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Unlike most  ci , this one is composed of three stanzas (as are several others by Liu Yong). The first two stanzas concern what the speaker sees while travelling across the country by boat; in the third stanza, prompted by these sights, he reflects on his own life choices. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Liu Yong was possibly the most widely-read  ci  writer in the Northern Song period, with fans ranging from courtesans to officials and critics. He excelled in writing love songs, portraying the emotions of lovelorn individuals in unprecedented detail and depth. Despite being born into a family of officials, he did not lead a successful professional life. After he failed  keju , the Imperial Chinese civil service examination, he wrote the song “To the tune ‘Crane Soaring in the Sky’”, \n in which he claimed that  ci  poets are as important as prime ministers. This led the Ren Emperor of Song 宋仁宗 to \n personally deem him unfit for imperial service. The emperor suggested that if he really thought that way, he should just be a  ci  poet instead of pursuing the career of an official.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This  ci  was written by Liu Yong after he failed  keju , the Imperial Chinese civil service examination, and it is this  ci  that leads the Ren Emperor of Song 宋仁宗 to personally deem him unfit for imperial service, which further impedes his political career. In the first stanza of this  ci , the poet explains his failing in  keju  as the emperor “miss[ing] out on the talented ones”, and makes the unconventional claim that being the  ci  poet is a profession that is as important and praiseworthy as being a state bureaucrat. In the second stanza, the poet envisions a future filled with “romantic affairs and pleasures”. This hedonistic outlook and cynicism towards the empire are very different from the views typically expressed in Chinese society at that time, which are largely influenced by Confucianism and propose a positive attitude towards making contribution to the empire and the people through becoming state officials and taking up responsibilities of different social roles. Compared to other  ci  featured in the Liu Yong collection, this piece is composed earlier, and is often considered as the starting point of Liu Yong’s rebelliousness. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Childbirth in medieval Europe was often the most dangerous experience of a woman’s life. Because of poor hygiene and a lack of gynecological knowledge, scholars have estimated that as many as ten percent of women died during childbirth or immediately afterwards. Not only did mothers die in large numbers, but as many as thirty percent of children died in the process of childbirth. In the face of these dangers, medieval people used a wide variety of charms and prayers in an attempt to improve their chances of a successful delivery. \n The  Marston Childbirth Prayer  is a late 14th-century childbirth prayer from England, written in Latin. This prayer provides rare insight into the life of a medieval woman, speaking directly to one of the most intimate and dangerous experiences of her life. \n The prayer draws primarily on three stories from the Christian Bible: the creation of the world, the conception of Isaac, and the conception and birth of Christ. The first part of the prayer focuses on God’s generative power: the creation of land and sea, plants and animals, and Adam and Eve. The next part recalls the birth of Isaac, focusing on the miraculous fertility of Abraham and Sarah despite their advanced ages. The prayer then turns to the conception and birth of Jesus, focusing both on Mary’s pregnant body and on the divine nature of her son. The three biblical narratives referenced in Marston MS 22 are all concerned with generation and are the three main foundation stories in Christianity: the birth of the world, the birth of Judaism (through Isaac, the grandfather of the twelve tribes of Israel), and the birth of Christianity (through Christ). The prayer concludes with a reminder of Christ’s promise that God would intervene on behalf of those who cry out in his name. This allows the prayer, in its final lines, to petition for both mother and child to survive the pregnancy. \n Of key interest here is the way this prayer may have been used to aid a woman in childbirth. By reminding her of the biblical birthing narratives, it links the individual medieval woman with her broader Christian community and the longer arc of Christian history. In this way, the woman may feel connected to the biblical mothers it mentions and draw confidence that she, too, will be able to safely give birth. \n Also featured in this collection is a childbirth charm: https://sourcebook.stanford.edu/text/junius-peperit-charm. \n Introduction to the Source \n This prayer was added by a later scribe to folios 91v-92r of Marston MS 22, a medieval Book of Hours. Marston MS 22 is written on parchment in a large gothic bookhand with three discernible hands (ff. 1r, 2r-91r, 93r-115v, respectively). The added childbirth prayer is copied in an Anglicana script. Based on its script and its decoration, Marston MS 22 was probably produced in England around 1250 CE. The added childbirth prayer was added later, possibly around 1400, when Marston MS 22 was rebound. \n About this Edition \n This text was transcribed from Marston MS 22, ff. 91v-92r, which is held in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. A digitization can be viewed online here: https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2013548. Some spellings have been standardized and errors corrected.

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Muspilli is an incomplete verse narrative (104 lines) written in Old High German. The manuscript containing the poem, which was produced in Bavaria (southern Germany) in the 9th century CE, contains neither the beginning nor the end of the poem. The reason for its incompleteness is probably due to its having been written in the margins of another text: a Latin theological work composed by Adalram (d. 836), bishop of Salzburg, for the young Louis the German (ca. 810–876). It appears Muspilli was added to the manuscript later by a different scribe, but little can be deduced about who produced the text or why. It is conjectured that the beginning and end have been lost because they would have been written on the outermost pages of the manuscript, which often incur the most damage over time. One of the most debated questions about Muspilli is its name. The original manuscript does not include a title, and the name Muspilli was assigned by the poem’s first editor, Johann Andreas Schmeller. The name comes from the Old High German word muspille , meaning the destruction of the world by fire, which occurs in line 57 of the poem. This is the only known occurrence of this word. Scholars have since tried to give it various names which better suit the purpose of the poem, but none of these has stuck. \n Muspilli mainly deals with two main ideas: the fate of human souls after death and the Final Judgement. The first part of the poem describes how two groups of angels will fight over one soul to see whether it belongs in Heaven or Hell. The second part of the poem provides two narratives: Elijah and the Antichrist fight each other, the former as the champion of God and the latter as the champion of the Devil. In this duel, the Antichrist will be defeated and Elijah will be wounded and his blood will burn the whole world. Then the text describes how, in the Final Judgement, angels and demons will testify to the actions of humans on earth, and those actions will be scrutinized. At the end of the poem, the Holy Cross is brought forth and Christ reveals the wounds that he suffered for the sake of humankind. \n One of the most discussed aspects of this poem are its sources. Although explicitly Christian elements are abundant, scholars have argued that  Muspilli  is deeply infused with pre-Christian culture and draws much of its material from Norse mythology. Although the names mentioned in the poem are all Christian figures, some scholars argue that they are essen- tially the Christian representation of Norse gods. \n Muspilli is considered to be one of the most significant pieces of Old High German literature because of its vivid depiction of Christian themes in the vernacular language. Through this poem, modern readers can gain a better insight into the spiritual life and broader culture of ninth-century Germans. \n Further Reading \n Murdoch, Brian. “The Carolingian Period and the Early Middle Ages (750–1100).”  The Cambridge History of German Literature , edited by Helen Watanabe-O’Kelly.

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This Quechua poem first appeared in the Spanish-language  Comentarios Reales de los Incas  (1609), a history of the Pre-Columbian Inca empire, authored by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish conquistador and an Incan noblewoman. Scholars know very little beyond what Inca Garcilaso himself relates in his history about the poem. It appears in a chapter dedicated to the poetic accomplishments of the Incas, in which Inca Garcilaso accounts for the role that poetry played in how the Incas kept records of their achievements, cultural traditions, and beliefs. According to him, Inca poetry comprised “few verses, so that they could be memorized; but they were also very condensed, like cyphers to be decoded.” This description befits the poem translated here, “Sumaq Ñusta” (“Noble Lady”), in which few verses construct a whole narrative about the different forms of precipitation in the Andes (rain, thunderstorms, snow, hail). For Inca Garcilaso, poetry was the medium by which the Incas communicated not only their history, but also their knowledge about the natural world. \n Inca Garcilaso writes that Blas Valera, another mixed-race intellectual from colonial Peru, transcribed the poem from ancient  khipus , the traditional system of record-keeping used by the Incas. (The  khipu  system recorded information using cords of different colors, into which small knots were tied, which could represent words, numbers, or concepts.) Valera translated the poem into Latin, keeping the original spondaic syllable structure of Quechua. In the  Comentarios Reales , that Inca Garcilaso argues that Inca poetry was much closer to the poetry of the great ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome than it was to the Spanish culture of his own time, and he musters this poem as evidence. Both the Quechua and the Latin versions appear in the  Comentarios Reales , to which Inca Garcilaso adds his own translation into Spanish, in which language he is unable to preserve the original spondaic meter. The English translation presented here is a direct translation from the Quechua original. \n The poem relates a story of the many forms that water takes when it falls from the sky, contrasting the violent rain during thunderstorms with gentler, and more useful, rain. The addressee of the poem is a woman of noble ascent—a  ñusta , like Inca Garcilaso’s mother—who was chosen by the gods to regulate the various natural phenomena of precipitation. Although there is a predominant tone of gratitude towards the  ñusta , whom the speaker thanks for sending water only in beneficial, unthreatening forms, the first half of the poem is an indirect, somewhat accusatory address. The accusation is not directed at the ñusta, but at her brother, whom the speaker credits with causing thunderstorms. It is because he breaks the  ñusta ’s water jug, instead of gently pouring water from it, that such storms occur. The story of these siblings features a binary idea of gender, which is mapped onto them: the brother is violent (he breaks the jug) and disrespectful (he usurps his sister’s role as trustee of the jug), whereas the sister is gentle and caring, even though she sends hail and snow at times. \n Moreover, this short poem constitutes a good example of how pre-modern Quechua culture relates to the material world by ascribing consciousness and intent to the rules by which the world is governed. While the  ñusta  and her brother are both of presumed royal ascent, they are not necessarily deities in the same way as, for example, the gods of the Greek pantheon (e.g. Zeus, Hera, Athena, etc.) were thought to be. The Incas believed that mountains and rivers had as much power and agency as human beings (if not more), and the nameless  ñusta  and her brother may fit better into this category of agents of nature. Although the gods Pachakamaq and Viraqucha chose the  ñusta  to govern precipitation, it \n is interesting to consider the importance of the object from which the water stems: the clay jug. The noble lady’s power is curtailed since the jug may be manipulated by others (i.e. her brother), suggesting that the jug itself may control the waters falling from the sky, and the  ñusta  and her brother simply guide the water’s form. \n About this Edition \n This poem was transcribed from the original edition of  Comentarios Reales de los Incas   (1609), printed in Lisbon. The John Carter Brown Library holds a copy of it, whose digitized version can be accessed here: https://archive.org/details/ primerapartedelo00vega. Inca Garcilaso’s original spelling of Quechua has been modified to reflect modern-day spelling of the Ayacucho-Chanca variant of Quechua. The main difference here is the substitution of “q” for “c” to represent the guttural phoneme (non-existent in English), and the use of “k” instead of “c” for the voiceless velar stop phoneme (like the “c” in English, as it is pronounced in the word can).

This was the prototypical song type in Germany at the turn of the sixteenth century and enjoyed particular prominence at the court of the Emperor Maximilian. \n Introduction to the Source \n Digitized copies of these partbooks are available online from the Bayerische StaatsBibliothek in Munich: https:// stimmbuecher.digitale-sammlungen.de//view?id=bsb00082229. \n Further Reading \n Keyl, Stephen. “Tenorlied, Discantlied, Polyphonic lied: Voices and instruments in German secular polyphony of the Renaissance.”  Early Music , vol. 20, no. 3, 1992, pp. 434–445. \n Saunders, Steven. “Music in Early Modern Germany.”  Early Modern German Literature 1350-1700 , edited by Max Reinhart, Rochester: Camden House, 2007. \n Wer trew mit valsch vergelten wil / der hat das spil \n / in aller wellt mit recht verloren / und kündt er schiessen noch sovil / er trifft kayn zil / ich wolt es gult im seine oren / prauch allen fleis / er wird mit solcher weys / der khegel nit vil scheiben / er hat kain glückh / weyl er solch tückh thůt treyben. \n Ich hann zwar lanng auff das gewart / ob er ayn fart \n / trew gůttat wurd noch recht erkennen / die mich můß ewig rewen hart / hyetz woll erspart / ein när- rin můß ich mich selbs nennen / will suchen weg / damit ich füran pfleg / der rue unnd mich verhüte / vor solchem gwin / das ist mein sin und gmüte. \n Will mich wol schicken recht darein / und mer- cken feyn / wie er sich than hat gen mir halten / verschlossen ist das hertze mein / recht wye ayn schreyn / vor im wil mein selbs walten / ob kem ayn not / das ich nit fall in spot / von im wer ich verlassen / verstee gantz wol / das ich mich sol / sein massen. \n Whoever repays loyalty with falsehood, has lost the game for all to see, and with good reason, and if he could shoot even more, he still wouldn’t hit a target: I’d hope that it costs him his ears.

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This short preface to Pope Gregory the Great’s  Regula Pastoralis  ( Pastoral Rule  or  Pastoral Care ) offers an unusual account of the genesis of that text, composed—so the preface says—during travel that Gregory undertook through Gaul in an attempt to avoid becoming pope. By contrast, the standard narrative of the  Pastoral Care ’s origin sees it completed presumably in Rome, not long after Gregory’s papal inauguration, and sent off thence to John, Bishop of Ravenna. (History supports the second version of events: Gregory was first in Constantinople, then Rome, prior to assuming the papacy.) Gregory’s initial reluctance to become pope is a constant in both origin stories, however, even if he is more active in his escapism in the preface presented here. The tally noted in the preface extends Gregory’s time in office by four months. He was pope from September 3, 590 to March 12, 604: thirteen years, six months (not ten months), and nine days. The etymology of Gregory’s name is sound. \n The preface also alludes to a second alternate history of the  Pastoral Care , one that is introduced in a more displaced way: “And others think that…” This origin story is vague with its mentions of an “emperor of the Goths” and a “demented leader of the Romans,” but these could be references to Justin II, Emperor of the Byzantine Empire (r. 565-74), and Leovigild, the Visigothic king with whom he contended. (Justin II notably suffered from mental illness.) This would place the text’s purported composition sometime between 565 and 574; for context, Gregory entered monastic life in 574. \n Introduction to the Source \n To the best of my knowledge, this text has not been previously edited or translated. I have found it in two English manuscripts that were produced centuries apart and that bear no direct relation to one another: Oxford, St. John’s College, MS 28 (s. x med. and x3/4 or x/xi; the  Pastoral Care  is in the slightly later part), fol. 6v and Oxford, Merton College, MS 16, (s. xiv ex., xv1), fol. 139va. The text must certainly exist in more manuscript witnesses of the  Pastoral Care , from a range of times and—one assumes, given the text’s continental origin—of places. \n About this Edition \n I have transcribed this text diplomatically from St. John’s College, MS 28 and double-checked it against Merton College, MS 16. The two witnesses follow each other word-for-word except for two presumed misspellings: MS 16 reads  tritor  for  nutritor  and  plicipatum  for  principatum . The only other differences are the spelling, punctuation and abbreviations used: a remarkable fixity, in view of the centuries between the two known versions. On my decision to translate  brigalis  as “Bruges”:  brigalis  is described as a city in  gallia belgica  (“Belgian Gaul”), and Bruges was indeed settled by the late sixth century, so it would have been an option to a fleeing Gregory. But I have not found  brigalis  as an attested Latin term for “Bruges” (or indeed for anywhere else in Belgian Gaul). Brigalis, then, is either evidence of a further place-name for Bruges or a name of a different city. \n I would like to thank the Lynne Grundy Memorial Trust for funding my travel within the UK to examine the Oxford manuscripts named here and the Scriptorium Working Group at Yale University for discussing this fascinating little text with me, as well as the team behind the  Global Medieval Sourcebook . \n Further Reading \n Godden, Malcolm. “Prologues and Epilogues in the Old English Pastoral Care, and Their Carolingian Models.”  Journal of English and Germanic Philology , vol. 110, no. 4, 2011, pp. 441-73. \n St. Gregory the Great.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The song lyric was allegedly composed in the following context: when Ouyang Xiu was a junior governor at Henan (a prov- ince in China), he had a romantic relationship with a local singer. At that time, Qian Weiyan was the lead governor of Henan. One day when Qian was hosting a party in his garden, Ouyang Xiu and the singer were late. Qian asked them the reason for their delay. The singer answered: “The weather is too hot, and I had heatstroke. I was sleeping in a cool room and lost my golden hairpin.” When Qian heard these words, he laughed and said to the singer: “If Ouyang Xiu can write a  ci  about this, I will give you the money for your lost hairpin.” Ouyang Xiu then wrote the following lyric, and Qian, satisfied, gave the singer money for her hairpin. The not-so-subtle cleverness of this lyric is that it describes the couple making love (in the second stanza), once they go inside and lower the curtain. So this is an alternate explanation of why the couple was late to the party, the suggestive indirectness of which would have amused everyone who heard the singer perform it. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written \n texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Ouyang Xiu was a highly influential politician, scholar, and historian of the Northern Song dynasty. He was revered as a grand master of literature and philosophy, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he laid the foundation for the literati mentality of the dynasty. When Ouyang was four years old, the death of his father, a fifty-seven-year-old military officer, left the family destitute. Poverty did not stop Ouyang’s passion for reading: he would borrow books from his neighbors and make copies in order to study them further. Later, he became a bureaucrat and was posted to many cities as a prefect of the imperial court. In his political life, he was principled and solemn, and wrote a great deal in many genres. Much of his writing reflects his dignified character. His song lyrics, however, provide an interesting contrast. Their content may be drawn in part from the colorful private life he enjoyed in his younger years, including liaisons with many different courtesans. In- terestingly, they are often written from the perspective of a lovelorn courtesan abandoned by an inconstant lover, in effect casting himself as the villain. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1.

Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written \n texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Ouyang Xiu was a highly influential politician, scholar, and historian of the Northern Song dynasty. He was revered as a grand master of literature and philosophy, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he laid the foundation for the literati mentality of the dynasty. When Ouyang was four years old, the death of his father, a fifty-seven-year-old military officer, left the family destitute. Poverty did not stop Ouyang’s passion for reading: he would borrow books from his neighbors and make copies in order to study them further. Later, he became a bureaucrat and was posted to many cities as a prefect of the imperial court. In his political life, he was principled and solemn, and wrote a great deal in many genres. Much of his writing reflects his dignified character. His song lyrics, however, provide an interesting contrast. Their content may be drawn in part from the colorful private life he enjoyed in his younger years, including liaisons with many different courtesans. In- terestingly, they are often written from the perspective of a lovelorn courtesan abandoned by an inconstant lover, in effect casting himself as the villain. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1. Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since  ci  poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differentiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often be deduced by the translator from context. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Born in Florence around the year 1300, Jacopo Passavanti entered the Dominican order at a young age. After studying theology in Paris, he taught philosophy in Pisa and theology in Siena and Rome. He was then appointed prior at the convent of Santa Maria Novella, and episcopal vicar at the diocese of Florence. He died in Florence in 1357. \n In the Specchio di Vera Penitenza he collected his Lenten sermons of 1354: written in Tuscan vernacular, these sermons are divided into five distinctions and four treatises. His writing, directed towards the goals of spiritual meditation and purification, analyzes several topics embracing the religious experience of penance, and the related subjects of pride, humility, boastfulness, science, and dreams. \n Passavanti uses several exempla to illustrate his treatise, drawing on a vast oral and written tradition: the episode translated here, widely known as ‘Il Carbonaio di Niversa’ (The Charcoal-Burner of Nevers), exploits the traditional medieval literary topos of the hunt, which is also present in Dante’s  Divine Comedy  (Inf, XIII, 109-129), and especially in the short story ‘Nastagio degli Onesti’ in Boccaccio’s  Decameron  (V, 8). \n About this Edition \n This is a new translation of an episode from Jacopo Passavanti’s 1354 collection of sermons,  Lo Specchio della Vera Penitenza .

Giugnendo la femmina alla fossa, ch’ardea, non passò più oltre, e nella fossa non ardiva di gittarsi; ma correndo intorno alla fossa, fu so praggiunta dalcava- liere, che dietro le correa; la quale traendo guai, presa per li svolazzanti o capelli, crudelmente la feri per lo mezzo del petto col coltello che tenea in mano. E cadendo in terra, con molto ispargimento di sangue, si la riprese per li in- sanguinati capelli, e gittòlla nella fossa de’carboni ardenti; dove lasciandola stare per alcuno spazio di tempo, tutta focosa e arsa la ritolse; e ponéndolasi davanti in sul collo del cavallo, correndo se n’andò per la via dond’era venuto. \n La seconda e la terza notte vide il carbonaio la simile visi- one.

    "textauthor": "Various",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n “Regarding Sister Agnes Waller of Blessed Memory” is one of several spiritual biographies written by, for, and about the late-medieval nuns of the Dominican monastery of Unterlinden (or  Sub tilia  in Latin) in their book of  Vitae sororum  (“Lives of sisters”). The monastery of Unterlinden was founded in the mid-13th century, in the town of Colmar, Alsace (today’s France; a German-speaking region in the Middle Ages). \n The Unterlinden  Vitae sororum  belongs to the late-medieval genre of Sisterbooks (also known as  Schwesternbücher, Non- nenbücher , or Convent Chronicles). These are collections of spiritual biographies, similar to saints’ lives (a.k.a.  vitae ), recording the lives and devotions of the community’s sisters. They were usually collectively authored by the nuns, in either Latin or a Middle High German dialect regional to the monastery, and updated over subsequent generations. The Unterlin- den  Vitae sororum  was probably composed between the late 13th and early 14th centuries. \n The entry concerning Sister Agnes Waller is typical of this genre, and particularly notable for its focus on affective piety and the Eucharist. The author of Sister Agnes’s entry praises her holy way of living, calls her a “living sacrifice” and “de- voted servant” of the divine, and describes her as “betrothed to God” even before she enters the monastery. At the point of taking her vows, Sister Agnes renounces the secular world and experiences a divine feeling so overwhelming that she begins spontaneously bleeding from her mouth and nostrils. Another miracle happens to Sister Agnes in the monastery: during the celebration of the Mass, she receives a vision of Christ as a beautiful child, white in body and surrounded by red “like an infant newly born.” The author presents Sister Agnes as an example of complete renunciation of the world in favour of a life dedicated to God. Both of the visions attributed to her show the focus on the Eucharist and the humanity of Christ which was common in late-medieval women’s devotion across Europe. \n Introduction to the Source \n The Unterlinden  Vitae sororum  was produced at the monastery of Unterlinden (Colmar, Alsace), between the late 13th and early 14th centuries. It comes down to us in a 15th-century copy held at the Bibliothèque municipale in Colmar (MS. 508). There is also a fragmentary copy held in Paris (Cod. lat. 5642 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France) and a translation of the  Vitae sororum  into Middle High German, dated to the 15th century, which exists in at least two copies (Cod. 164.1 Extravagantes in the Wolfenbüttel Herzog-August-Bibliothek; MS. MA59 in the archive of St Katherine’s Dominican monas- tery at Zöffingen). The existence of multiple copies of this manuscript and its translations, indicates that the lives of the sisters of Unterlinden were transmitted to other monasteries as well. \n The Unterlinden  Vitae sororum  offers a good example of the type of collective authorship typical of Sisterbooks. After the first 37 chapters, there is an addition of three more under the heading “Regarding those neglected and omitted above” ( De omissis superius et neglectis ) followed by a note that “I, Sister Catherine, raised in this monastery from childhood, completed this work” ( Explicit liber. Ego soror Katharina in eodem monasterio a puericia enutrita hoc opus exegi. Summo sit gloria regi. ). Five more chapters describing the lives of Unterlinden nuns then follow. \n About this Edition \n This new translation is based on Jeanne Ancelet-Hustache’s 1930 edition of the  Vitae sororum , which is available on JSTOR. The full manuscript is also available, digitized, on the website of the Bibliothèque municipale de Colmar. \n Further Reading \n Ancelet-Hustache, Jeanne, ed. “Les ‘Vitae sororum’ d’Unterlinden: Édition critique du manuscrit 508 de la bibliothèque de Colmar.”  Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littèraire du Moyen Âge,  vol. 5, 1930, pp. 317–513. \n Cails, Sœur Élie.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n De Heinrico (literally “of Heinrich,” and here translated as “The Song of Heinrich”) is a tenth-century historical narrative poem which gives an account of an Emperor called Otto greeting a Duke called Heinrich and handing over most of his power to him, though retaining his title. There has been considerable scholarly debate over who exactly Otto and Heinrich are, given that there are so many noblemen of those names in this period in Germany. The most popular explanations are that the poem is about either (1) Otto I the Great and his brother Heinrich, who were reconciled in 941 CE, or (2) Otto III, who was a small child when Heinrich the Quarrelsome was reconciled with the court and became regent in 991 CE. \n A further mysterious element comes in line 14, where Otto greets Heinrich saying, “Welcome Heinrich, both of you with the same name.” There is little scholarly consensus as to whom the second Heinrich with the same name could be, with some scholars even suggesting this accepted translation is completely wrong. Both Otto and Heinrich are portrayed as humble Christians who do not covet power. \n The poem consists of eight stanzas, each with either three or four lines. The first half of each line is in Latin and the seconds half is in Old High German. \n Introduction to the Source \n The poem survives in only one source, commonly referred to as the Cambridge Songs Manuscript ( Carmina Cantabrigiensia ), which contains many examples of Goliardic Medieval poetry, which is mostly in Latin but includes some French and German vernacular poems as well. The Goliards were young clergymen and university students who became poets and writers and were often critical of the church. Scholars have speculated that the Cambridge Songs Manuscript may have been a songbook for wandering minstrels, though it is more likely to have belonged to a court as their collection of songs. The original was probably made in France before the Norman Conquest in 1066 CE and was copied before being lost or destroyed, with the surviving copy making its way to the church of St. Augustine at Canterbury and eventually to Cambridge University. A number of the songs and poems in the manuscript were set to music by Carl Orff in the twentieth century as his famous  Carmina Burana . \n Further Reading \n Bostock, John K, K C. King, and D R.

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The  Song of Peter  is the oldest surviving hymn in the German language. Hymns are a form of religious poetry sung in praise of God, often during religious ceremonies such as the Mass celebrated by medieval Christians. The tradition of Christian hymns was popularised in the West by Ambrose of Milan (c. 340–397 CE), who wrote hymns in Latin (though some claim that Hilary of Poitiers was the first composer of Latin hymns). Hymns in the “Ambrosian” style remained a very popular part of Christian worship until the Council of Trent (1545–63 CE), when most hymns were abolished from Catholic liturgical practice. The  Song of Peter  is transmitted with neumes, an early medieval form of musical notation, which suggests that it was supposed to be sung, possibly during religious processions. \n Written down in the first third of the tenth century CE in a Bavarian dialect of the Old High German language, it is one of the earliest examples of end rhyme in a German text. This was a change from the Germanic alliterative verse which dominated earlier, where the same consonants were repeated within the same line. It is unknown whether the author of the  Song of Peter  was influenced by the end rhymes of Otfrid of Weißenburg’s Gospel Harmony (composed c. 870 CE) or whether the  Song of Peter  predates Otfrid’s work. \n The song calls upon St. Peter the Apostle in three strophes of three lines. Each strophe ends with the refrain, “ Kyrie eleyson. Christe eleyson ”, which is Greek for “God, have mercy. Christ, have mercy.” The refrain points to Peter’s special role in the Christian faith as the overseer of admission into Heaven (see, for example, the Biblical passage Matthew 16:19: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven”). \n Introduction to the Source \n The song survives in only one manuscript, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Clm 6260, now held in Munich. The manuscript originally stems from the Freising Cathedral library and was written in the second half of the ninth century CE. It contains discussions, in Latin, of religious texts. The  Song of Peter  was written down later, on the very last page below the end of Hrabanus’s Maurus Commentary on Genesis (f.158v). \n Further Reading \n Bostock, John Knight.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Su Shi wrote this song on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, a harvest festival on the full moon, to express his home- sickness after a seven-year separation from his brother. It includes broader philosophical reflections on happiness, sor- row and separation. It is interesting to note how Su Shi draws connections between the moon’s shape and the grieving, rejoicing, separating and reuniting of human beings. In ancient China, a full moon was a metaphor for happiness and fulfilled goals, whereas a moon that wasn’t full meant loss and regret. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes.

One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”).

Before Su Shi, the primary form of  ci  was  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”).

The first stanza describes a hunting trip in which many local people participated: a sign of their respect for Su Shi.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Su Shi wrote this song as a response to a song about willow catkins by his friend, Zhang Zhifu. He uses the same rhyming schemes as Zhang Zhifu to depict the capricious nature of willow catkins. Although Su Shi is known for the bold style of his songs, this song is a good example of his facility at describing subtler images and emotions. The imagery of blown catkins ( 柳絮 ) suggests an unsettled, tragic life without a sense of belonging.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n In 1078 CE, the poet was the Prefect of Xuzhou. The poem was written when he spent a night in the Swallow Tower, one of the five most famous towers in Xuzhou, and dreamt about Guan Panpan, a courtesan who dwelt in Swallow Tower during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE). Su Shi had an unfortunate political career, during which he was often exiled and reassigned. His feelings about this can be seen in the first three lines of the second stanza, in which the poet expresses his exhaustion from all the travelling required by his constant reassignments, as well as his longing for his hometown. This world-weariness spurs philosophical reflections on life, which he regards as dream-like and illusory. The sentiment that all lived experience is a dream strongly connotes Buddhist thought, specifically one of the Buddist classic texts, the  Diamond Sutra . \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

Before the composition of this song, Su Shi had passed by the hall twice due to transfers at work. The song marks the occasion of his third visit to Pingshan Hall, at which point Ouyang Xiu had long since passed away. The song serves to commemorate Su Shi’s teacher, as well as to reflect on the inconstancy of life; the latter effort is supported by Su Shi’s use of Buddhist imagery, such as “a flick of the finger” to express the rapid passing of time.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This  ci  was written in 1096 CE, when Su Shi was sixty years old. It is a eulogy for Zhaoyun, who was a longtime female companion of Su Shi in his later life. The precise nature of her role (concubine, female servant, or courtesan accepted into his household) is contested by the scholars. Zhaoyun had accompanied the speaker to Huizhao in Guangdong, a coastal province in southeast China, when he was demoted by the Song court. The lyrics seem to be describing plum blossoms, but are actually using the image of a plum blossom as an extended metaphor for Zhaoyun’s beauty and pure heart. In Chi- nese culture, it is traditionally believed that the plum blossom flourishes in harsh conditions, blooming only in the winter. The metaphor therefore highlights how she was able to thrive in difficult circumstances. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Su Shi 蘇軾 is one of the most popular Chinese poets of all time, and certainly one of the best-known poets of the Song Dynasty. Among his many roles—principled politician, esteemed poet, celebrated calligrapher—he was also a major re- former of the  ci  genre. Before Su Shi, the primary form of  ci  was  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”). This was considered to be an inferior form of literature due to its thematic focus on love and desire and its association with the courtesans who usually performed it. Su Shi wrote lyrics on a broad range of non-traditional topics, often closely related to his own life experience. His compositions dealt with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. As a pioneer of the  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”) type of  ci , he incorporated references to typically masculine pursuits, including frequent use of a hunting motif. He also frequently incorporated ideas from Buddhist philosophy and allusions to political events, which usually appeared only in more elevated forms of poetry. \n Although Su Shi was a highly-regarded poet during his lifetime, his political career was consistently unfortunate. In 1066, he was forced to leave the Court when he openly opposed the chancellor’s socio-economic reforms, known as the New Policies. Over the next thirteen years, he was frequently demoted, serving as prefect or sub-prefect in Hangzhou, Mizhou, Xuzhou and Huzhou. Many of his  ci  reference these postings and the exhaustion of constant travel. A report about the troubling economic conditions of local people written while he was prefect of Huzhou landed him in prison for three months. He was finally sent back to Hangzhou and given a job with no salary. Although living in poverty, he grew fond of Hangzhou and wrote many of his most famous  ci  there. \n Because of the occurrence of specific real names and locations in Su Shi’s lyrics, as well as the introductory notes he wrote to accompany many of them, his lyrics often invite a biographical reading.

Chen Shu- gu was a friend of Su Shi and the poet wrote this song on the occasion of Chen Shugu’s sendoff at West Lake.

Despite his diminished circumstances, he remained defiant and criticized others for going along with the reforms. In this song, he compares himself to a lone wild goose ( 鸿 ), conveying both pride in his choices and the loneliness of his new position. The wild goose was often used by Chinese poets to represent heroic figures with grand ambitions.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The Sultan’s Daughter in the Flower Garden is a 400-line rhymed couplet text in Middle High German that was probably composed anonymously in the 14th century. Categorized in scholarship as a “Klosterlegende” or monastery legend, but also exhibiting characteristics of saints’ lives, courtship narratives, stories of noble “heathens” who convert, as well as of docta ignorantia (learned ignorance) and Marian literature, the narrative was probably translated from a no longer extant Latin source and is also transmitted in low German prose versions, as well as in song form. \n While the prose versions have a modest transmission in late medieval manuscripts and early modern prints, the songs’ reception stretches into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The Middle High German rhymed couplet version presented here appears, however, in only two late fifteenth-century manuscripts: Berlin, Staatsbibiliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, mgo 222, dated to after 1475, and Budapest, Bibl. et Archivum P. P. Franciscanorum, Cod. Esztergom 11, dated to around 1500. \n Both manuscripts were produced in the southern German-speaking areas and tell the following story: after learning of the arrival of a foreign nobleman whom her father wishes her to wed, the daughter of the Sultan of Babylon goes into their beautiful garden. Among the flowers, she marvels at the beauty of the lilies, whereupon an angel appears and recruits her to worship the God who made them, as long as she can commit to complete chastity. She agrees and he whisks her 3000 miles away, instructing her in the Christian mysteries along the way. The angel delivers her to a convent where she is accepted, baptized, educated, and eventually becomes abbess. \n The dominant aspects of the tale situate it most comfortably in the traditions of Marian literature and  docta ignorantia  narratives. The references to lilies, to chastity, and to the annunciation from the angel in an enclosed garden come into greater relief in the Berlin manuscript compilation, which includes a number of other texts relating to the Marian tradition (e.g., a  pater noster  exegesis, a treatise about the rosary, a devotion to Mary, a set of Marian miracles, and an allegory about the heart as cloister). This focus corresponds to the known ownership of the manuscript, which, as indicated in the pastedown on the inside front cover, was a reformed convent of Augustinian nuns in Inzigkofen, a town located about 25 miles north of Lake Constance. \n In contrast, the Budapest manuscript, most likely produced in a Franciscan context, seems more interested in instructing an audience of lay noblemen in the benefits of giving up their sinful behavior and embracing a more chaste existence for the sake of their fate in the afterlife. Accordingly, the other texts included in the Budapest compilation, many more of which are in verse—as opposed to the Berlin manuscript, where only the  Sultan’s Daughter  text is rhymed—focus on the concepts of sin and confession (e.g., model confession texts, a Latin catalogue of sins, verse prayer for a good end, a  Totentanz , the dream vision  Tundalus , a section from the  Lucidarius  on the afterlife, and two secular rhymed couplet tales:  The Count of Savoy  and  The Knight in the Chapel ). \n The text is noteworthy more for its content than for its poetic attributes, the rhymes and imagery being relatively mundane. \n The combination of the variety of narrative models into one tale is of interest, however, as well as the miraculous trajectory of the clever maiden from an object of exchange between men in Babylon to model Christian, scribe, teacher, and ultimately abbess of a German convent. In addition, the focus in the text on the choice to obey the angel, that is, on the maiden’s agency in determining her fate, is also striking. \n About this Edition \n The Middle High German text supplied here is based on Johannes Bolte’s 1890 edition, published in the  Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum  (volume 34, pages 18-31), which is a diplomatic transcription of the Berlin manuscript (fols. 160r–170v). I have adopted Bolte’s diacritics where possible. These include the regular umlaut as well as an  accent aigu  (´), which Bolte also used to indicate an umlauted vowel (presumably because the superscript e in the manuscript looks more like an accent than an e). Dipthongized vowels like a, u, and o, which in the manuscript are indicated with super- scripts, have been written out as av, uo, and ov. Superscript abbreviations for er, en, and em have been written out as well. The manuscript often uses a v to represent the vowel u and when this is umlauted, that is also indicated with what looks like an accent (instead of the umlaut or an e over the vowel). In the transcription here, these have been changed to ú (as in úmmer and úber). \n Bolte’s suggestions for emendations have been adopted and appear in square brackets. My own interjections appear in parentheses...."

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song, composed on April 24, 1542, was included in  Cronica , Sebastian Tinódi’s printed song collection of 1554. The songs in  Cronica  were accompanied by melodies and intended for performance before varied audiences as well as for private reading. The general topic of the collection is the defensive struggle of Hungarians against the Ottoman armies, and its songs can be described as event poetry (a genre which typically combines a narrative account of contemporary, momentous events with implicit or explicit political-cultural commentary). Tinódi significantly advanced the genre of event poetry in Hungarian literature and became a model for those who followed. \n In contrast to “The Loss of Buda and Captivity of Bálint Török” (also presented in the  Global Medieval Sourcebook ), this song exhibits fewer oral compositional elements and illustrates how Tinódi eventually developed a more definitive literate style with fewer formulae and repetitions. Nevertheless, for greater effect in performance, he deftly employs direct speech to admonish his audience and also to console his captive lord, Bálint Török. \n In this song, Tinódi laments the entrapment of three Hungarian magnates by the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman government). Each magnate’s arrest is described along with the resulting personal misfortune for the family, even though details are sparingly given. The fate of these nobles then forms the basis for a comparison of Ottoman and Hungarian beliefs and actions. Primary themes are the guile of the Ottomans on the one hand, and on the other, the factiousness, gullibility, imprudence and lack of Christian morality of the Hungarians. The opening lament (stanzas 1-2) contrasts the dire situation for the Hungarians with Ottoman glee. As the Sublime Porte gains from Hungarian foolhardiness, several stanzas admonish Hungarian lords severely in a direct address (stanzas 3-7, 32-34). The implication is that the Ottomans are united under one sovereign and one belief system, whereas the Hungarians are constantly divided. Thus the song blames the Hungarians themselves for their country’s calamities. \n Introduction to the Source \n Cronica , Sebastian Tinódi’s songbook of 1544, contains this song and twenty-one others together with his own musical compositions. It was printed in Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca, Romania). A few original copies are extant as facsimile editions. The source for this translation is the standardized transcription accessible on the Hungarian Electronic Library website, Tinódi Sebestyén összes költeménye:   http://mek.oszk.hu/01100/01100/index.phtml. \n About this Edition \n The goal has been to render the Hungarian in clear and smooth English prose. The original is composed of 50 mono- rhyming quatrains of morphemic rhymes using the popular 12 syllable line. This translation conforms to the quatrain structure while avoiding rhyme and meter. Each stanza expresses a complete thought or idea. This parallel stanza format facilitates comparison of translation to original. Punctuation follows the needs of modern English. Sometimes sentences have been split to accommodate English syntax and others have been connected. Names of well known, high-ranking persons have been anglicized; others have been modernized. All Hungarian names are given surname second. Places and persons named are capitalized and identified in the notes. Specific historical details mentioned are also explained in footnotes. Sections containing direct address are marked by syntax as the singer’s voice, and seldom lend themselves to setting off with quotation marks. Quotation marks are used only to indicate the speech of a character within the text. \n Further Reading \n Czigány, Lóránt,  Oxford History of Hungarian Literature from the Earliest Times to the Mid-1970s .

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The Middle Irish poem “Tuán mac Cairill—it was heard” tells the story of Tuán mac Cairill, a legendary figure said to have lived throughout the ages in the form of a human, stag, boar, bird and salmon. In this final form, he is eaten by the wife of an Irish king named Cairell, which causes her to become pregnant. She then gives birth to Tuán in the form of a man once again. \n The poem comes down to us as a semi-independent text which was added after “The Story of Tuán mac Cairill to Finnen of Mag Bile” (Scél Tuáin meic Cairill do Finnen Maige Bile) in two medieval manuscripts: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 512 [s. xv - s. svi], f. 98vb, and The Book of Fermoy (Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 23 E 29, pp. 17-216. As we see at the end of the poem, Tuán’s story is embedded in a frame narrative: Tuán has been conversing with Saint Finnian, describing how he has spent hundreds of years in different animal forms. \n A version of the story of Tuán was also inserted into the third recension (Recension C) of Lebor Gabála Érenn (literally, “The Book of the Taking of Ireland”), also known as “The Book of Invasions.” This pseudo-historical work was a medieval fabrication compiled from various biblical, classical, and native Irish sources, as well as more recent medieval material. These were woven together into a decidedly un-historical narrative which purports to recount five successive “invasions” of Ireland, from the time of Noah onwards. The purpose of the text was to provide the people of Ireland with a biblical ori- gin, including them in the medieval Christian milieu. It therefore includes a flood event, as well as a variety of rather fantas- tical invasion myths, during which various features of the land were created, and cultural skills and institutions founded. \n The theme of humans transforming into animal forms occurs in a number of early Irish and medieval Welsh narratives. In some stories, it is clear that the human beings are not just changing shape temporarily due to magical intervention, but are being ‘reborn’ in either human or animal form. It is interesting to note that several accounts by early classical authors mention that Celtic-speaking population groups in Gaul believed in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul. While it would be difficult to prove any kind of direct connection or continuity, the fairly widespread existence of related themes in ethnographic reports and literary sources is at least worthy of note. \n Introduction to the Source \n “Tuán mac Cairill—it was heard” is found in five separate manuscript sources. These include an early 15th-century vellum manuscript known as The Book of Lecan (Dublin, RIA, MS 535, f. 275, 23 P 2); a 14th- to 15th-century vellum manuscript known as The Book of Ballymote (Dublin, RIA, MS 536, p. 25); a 15th- to early 16th-century parchment manuscript known as Dublin, RIA, MS. Rawlinson B. 512 (f. 98vb); an 18th-century paper manuscript by scribe Aodh Ó Dálaigh (Dublin, RIA, MS 619, p. 41); and a 19th-century paper manuscript by scribe Joseph O’ Longan (Dublin, RIA, MS 803, p. 181). \n About this Edition \n The digital edition presented here is adapted from the 1901 edition of Dublin, RIA, MS Rawlinson B. 512 by Kuno Meyer (see “Further Reading” below). A portion of the poem was edited by R.A.S. Macalister in 1939, accompanied by a prelimi- nary translation of some stanzas. The remainder of the poem has remained untranslated and, as with many late 19th-cen- tury and early 20th-century materials, has been in need of a new translation. \n Further Reading \n Carey, John. editor and translator. “Scél Tuáin meic Chairill.” Éiru, vol. 35, 1984, pp. 93-111. \n \n An edition and translation of Scél Tuáin meic Cairill do Finnen Maige Bile (“The story of Tuán mac Cairill to Finnen of Mag Bile”). \n \n Carey, John, translator. “Scél Tuáin meic Chairill.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song depicts a romance between the speaker and a courtesan and the speaker’s regret at their separation. Imagery of drunkenness is used in an innovative way: the line “Not knowing who had put me onto a horse” was originally composed by the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai 李白 as a reference to drunkenness that would express his carefree attitude; here, how- ever, Yan Jidao uses the same line to express the opposite attitude: the desperation of his longing. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Yan Jidao 晏幾道 was the son of the eminent  ci  poet Yan Shu 晏殊 . Together, Yan Jidao and Yan Shu are often referred to as “double Yan,” with Yan Jidao being the “Little Yan 小晏 ” and Yan Shu being the “Big Yan 大晏 ,” reflecting the fact that during their lifetimes they were both the iconic poets of the  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) subgenre of  ci . Unlike his fa- ther, who held a prestigious state position alongside a blooming poetry career, Yan Jidao led a far more arduous life. As the seventh son of Yan Shu, he was born into a noble and wealthy family, and had little interest in officialdom at a young age. His lifestyle was extravagant, filled with luxurious banquets, joyous travels with friends, and beautiful courtesans. \n After Yan Shu passed away in Yan Jidao’s late teens, the young man realized the imminent financial difficulties which would befall him and abandoned his previously extravagant lifestyle, devoting himself to a political career. However, he struggled to replicate his father’s success and was framed for his involvement in the movement against Wang Anshi’s New Policies (a series of government reforms), which led to him being jailed. Even though he was quickly released, this incident did huge damage to both his political career and his finances. In his later years, he returned to writing  ci , and started compiling a collection of his own works, called  Little Mountain Ci  ( 小山 词 ). In the prologue to this collection, he wrote: “I now think of the ones who once drank with me. Some of them have passed away; others fell prey to illness. I read through my collection as if reliving my past sadnesses, joys, separations and gatherings, which now are like fanta- sies, or a sudden lighting strike, or a faded dream. Thus I could only cover my pages and mourn, for time slips away too \n fast, and past joys are illusory and unreal.” i \n As a poet of the  wǎnyuē  subgenre, Yan Jidao’s lyrics pay great attention to romantic affairs with courtesans. Compared to his contemporaries, Yan Jidao focuses more on the existential and emotional aspect rather than the physical aspect of these affairs, and incorporates more introspection into his poems. Because of the occurrence of specific names \n and locations in his  ci , some of his  ci  invite a biographical reading. However, as  ci  are song lyrics intended for multiple performances by different singers on different occasions, there is also a universal character to the sentiments evoked in Yan Jidao’s  ci  which transcends the poet’s personal experiences. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1. Beijing: Zhong- hua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since  ci  poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differ- entiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often ..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song commemorates a past affair between a man and a courtesan by recalling their first meeting. Yan Jidao uses a detailed description of the courtesan’s appearance to establish a melancholic tone, and the natural imagery of the changing leaves of the willow trees subtly suggests the passage of time. The willow tree is a common symbol of farewell and separation in Chinese poetry, since in ancient China there was a tradition of giving a willow branch to a person before their departure. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618- 907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song evokes the speaker’s reunion with a courtesan after a long separation. The first stanza recalls a joyful evening spent together before they parted, followed by the longing which the speaker has experienced ever since. The final lines anticipate an imminent reunion, but one tinged by the sorrowful expectation that it is not likely to be repeated anytime soon. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Yan Jidao 晏幾道 was the son of the eminent  ci  poet Yan Shu 晏殊 .

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n In this song, a farewell scene between a courtesan and her lover is depicted from the perspective of the courtesan. The lyrics convey both her sadness at his departure and her anger at the lack of commitment he has shown. Her complex emotions towards him reveal her deep love but also her powerlessness as a courtesan. An interesting image used here is the willow tree. This tree is a common symbol of farewell and separation in Chinese poetry, since in ancient China there was a tradition of giving a willow branch to a person about to depart. \n Another image worth mentioning is “cloud and rain” ( 雲雨 ), which is a euphemism for passionate sex, particularly within a relationship fated not to last. The expression comes from a writer, Song Yu 宋玉 , who lived during the Warring States period (453–221 BCE). In his  Song of Gao Tang  ( 高唐 赋 ), he narrates a brief love affair between the Huai King of Chu 楚 怀  王 and a mountain fairy which takes place in the king’s dream; in this dream, the mountain fairy describes her residence after their lovemaking as “made from the cloud in the morning, but comprised of rain in the evening.” “Cloud and rain” later became a common euphemism for sex in Chinese poetry. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

It evokes the speaker’s regret at Xiaolian’s departure. There is a notable use of natural imagery here to characterize the relationship between the speaker and the courtesan: their love is compared to the flow- ers and the moon. In ancient China, both blooming flowers and a full moon were metaphors for happiness and fulfilled goals, whereas wilting flowers and a waxing moon meant, respectively, loss and regret. The association between the blooming flowers and the full moon is captured in this Chinese idiom, 花好月 圆 . 花好月 圆 is an adjectival phrase that can be used to describe a positive experience. Its original meaning is related to conjugal bliss. The first two lines of the second stanza, “Flowers wither easily; the moon waxes with difficulty”, therefore suggest the speaker’s pessimism about the future of his relationship with Xiaolian. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

Ac- cording to  I Ching  ( 周易 ), an ancient Chinese divination text, the direction west is associated with the element “metal,” which was considered to be the dominant element in autumn. Autumn is usually associated with separation and loneliness, so the image of the western building is often used by poets as a symbol for such feelings.  I Ching  also states that the direction west is feminine, “yin” ( 阴 ). As a consequence, “the western building” often refers to the private room of women in a household. The western building is a recurring image in ci poetry and appears in several of the texts in this collection. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618- 907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many \n  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Yan Jidao 晏幾道 was the son of the eminent  ci  poet Yan Shu 晏殊 . Together, Yan Jidao and Yan Shu are often referred to as “double Yan,” with Yan Jidao being the “Little Yan 小晏 ” and Yan Shu being the “Big Yan 大晏 ,” reflecting the fact that during their lifetimes they were both the iconic poets of the  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) subgenre of  ci . Unlike his father, who held a prestigious state position alongside a blooming poetry career, Yan Jidao led a far more arduous life. As the seventh son of Yan Shu, he was born into a noble and wealthy family, and had little interest in officialdom at a young age. His lifestyle was extravagant, filled with luxurious banquets, joyous travels with friends, and beautiful courtesans. \n After Yan Shu passed away in Yan Jidao’s late teens, the young man realized the imminent financial difficulties which would befall him and abandoned his previously extravagant lifestyle, devoting himself to a political career. However, he struggled to replicate his father’s success and was framed for his involvement in the movement against Wang Anshi’s New Policies (a \n series of government reforms), which led to him being jailed. Even though he was quickly released, this incident did huge dam- age to both his political career and his finances. In his later years, he returned to writing  ci , and started compiling a collection of his own works, called  Little Mountain Ci  ( 小山 词 ). In the prologue to this collection, he wrote: “I now think of the ones who once drank with me. Some of them have passed away; others fell prey to illness. I read through my collection as if reliving my \n past sadnesses, joys, separations and gatherings, which now are like fantasies, or a sudden lighting strike, or a faded dream. Thus I could only cover my pages and mourn, for time slips away too fast, and past joys are illusory and unreal.” \n As a poet of the  wǎnyuē  subgenre, Yan Jidao’s lyrics pay great attention to romantic affairs with courtesans. Compared to his contemporaries, Yan Jidao focuses more on the existential and emotional aspect rather than the physical aspect of these affairs, and incorporates more introspection into his poems. Because of the occurrence of specific names \n and locations in his  ci , some of his  ci  invite a biographical reading. However, as  ci  are song lyrics intended for multiple performances by different singers on different occasions, there is also a universal character to the sentiments evoked in Yan Jidao’s  ci  which transcends the poet’s personal experiences. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song evokes a relationship between the speaker and the courtesan Xiaoping (whom Yan Jidao knew personally). The first stanza portrays the speaker waking up late after a night of drinking. The dreary scenery (“locked doors,” “low curtains”) reinforces the sense of nostalgia for a lost happiness. The second stanza portrays his first meeting with Xiaoping. An important concept here is “the sorrow of spring” 春恨 . The idea originates in the poignant brevity of springtime’s beauty in nature, and thus is often deployed in  ci  poetry to express the sentiment that “all good things must come to an end.” \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This piece is mostly focused on the description of spring scenery and the speaker’s sadness at the end of the spring. It can be read as an attempt to convey the beauty of nature as well as a metaphor for the transience of happiness. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).  Ci  is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because  ci  were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of  ci  vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing  ci  would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying  ci  would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many  ci  poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of  ci :  wǎnyuē  ( 婉 约 , “graceful”) and  háofàng  ( 豪放 , “bold”). The  wǎnyuē  subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the  háofàng  subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. \n Yan Shu, a powerful statesman in the early Northern Song court, had a long and successful career both as an official and as a poet. Among his many literary achievements (which include poetry, song lyrics and prose), his  ci  compositions are best known. His lyrics are elegant in their choice of words, controlled in the emotions they express, and not as playful as the  ci  of other well-known poets. They often capture feelings of solitude and sorrow, creating a melancholic mood, but the poet is rarely explicit about what triggers the worry or sadness. \n About this Edition \n The original text of this  ci  is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 ( Quan Song Ci  全宋詞 , vol 1. Beijing: Zhong- hua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since  ci  poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differ- entiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often be deduced by the translator from context. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This  ci  is regarded as Yan Shu’s masterpiece, because it conveys deep sentiments using few words. The first two lines of the second stanza are particularly admired for their parallelism and neat contrast. The song expresses feelings of sorrow and regret at the passage of spring. As in many of Yan Shu’s songs, there is no way to determine if the person being described is male or female. This is unusual and must be deliberate. It imparts to his songs a certain universality. The person before us could be anyone. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n The subtitle of this  ci  suggests that it is supposed to be a gift for a particular singer, yet it also serves as a general de- piction of a courtesan’s life during the Song Dynasty. One thing to be noted is the distinction between courtesans and singers. These two professions are often hard to discern in Song Dynasty  ci . Even though they have similar names in Chinese, 妓 ( ji ) for courtesans and 歌姬 ( ge ji ) for singers, and their place of work is often similar, the singers’ work did not involve prostitution. \n The two stanzas of this song are an example of antithesis. The first stanza is about how successful the singer was when she was younger, when she competed with the other “blossoms and willows” (i.e., courtesans) for men’s attention, and the second is about her troublesome and lonely life now that she is older and considered less desirable. This piece uses the example of one singer’s unfortunate fate to reflect on the lives of thousands of other singers: they were loved by affluent society when they were young, and cast aside when they were no longer valuable. At the same time, the song may have a secondary meaning as a reflection upon the poet’s own misfortune of not achieving the rank he wanted at the imperial court. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n In this  ci , the speaker recalls when he first met a beautiful woman. The first and final lines relate to the present, framing the old memories which make up the middle section of the song. This creates a contrast between the sorrowful and solitary present and the celebratory atmosphere when he first met his lover. The “flowers” mentioned in the closing lines have a double meaning: they are both flowering trees in the gardens where banquets were held and, even more, the female sing- ers and dancers who entertained at those banquets, like the young woman the poet recalls in the first stanza. \n The  ci  genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).
