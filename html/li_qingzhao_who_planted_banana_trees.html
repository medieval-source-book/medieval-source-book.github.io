<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>In this <i> ci</i> , Li Qingzhao employs the image of banana trees to obliquely convey the speaker’s state of mind. In the first stanza, she considers their visual impact: how the trees block the sunlight; the way their leaves resemble hearts. The speaker’s own heartbreak is signalled at the start of the second stanza, in which the poet evokes the sound of rain dripping from the banana leaves and the discontent that it provokes. The characterization of the speaker as a “northerner” suggests that this <i> ci </i> may be conveying the poet’s own feelings: she was forced to migrate to the south following the conquest of Kaifeng and the collapse of the Northern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The <i> ci </i> genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). <i> Ci </i> is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because <i> ci </i> were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of <i> ci </i> vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing <i> ci </i> would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying <i> ci </i> would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many <i> ci </i> poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of <i> ci</i> : <i> wǎnyuē </i> (<span> 婉</span> <span> 约</span> , “graceful”) and <i> háofàng </i> (<span> 豪放</span> , “bold”). The <i> wǎnyuē </i> subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the <i> háofàng </i> subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of <i> ci </i> but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dynasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry. Following the invasion of Kaifeng, she moved first to Nanjing and then</p>

<p>to Lin’an, where she spent the remaining decades of her life; her husband died in 1129. In contrast to the love themes of her earlier <i> ci</i> , much of her later poetry is concerned with the sorrow of her forced migration and her personal loneliness in her new surroundings.</p>

<h2>About this Edition</h2>
<p>The original text of this <i> ci </i> is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang <span> 唐圭璋</span> (<i> Quan Song Ci </i> <span> 全宋詞</span> , vol 1. Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since <i> ci </i> poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differentiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often be deduced by the translator from context.</p>

<p>Who planted the banana trees in front of the window? The shade fills up the courtyard.</p>
<p>The shade fills up the courtyard.</p>
<p>One leaf after another, one heart after another,</p>
<p>5 <span> folding and unfolding, with too much feeling.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Heartbroken on the pillow, the rain in the third hour drips on and on,</p>

<p>It saddens the northerner,</p>
<p>10 <span> who is not used to listening and thus rises from her bed.</span></p>
