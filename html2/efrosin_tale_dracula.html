<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>The story of Dracula has become a signature piece the Western literary canon thanks to Bram Stoker’s rendition of the centuries-old Eastern European tale. However, the original narrative, whose roots are believed to be from the Southern Slavic-speaking regions of Eastern Europe, is not a tale of love and everlasting life. It is an account of the life of Dracula’s prototype, the 15th-century Wallachian prince Vlad Tepes, whose merciless behavior as a voivode (warlord) led to the moniker Vlad the Impaler. The epithet Dracula is used in the text rather than the name Vlad. The origins of the moniker Dracula are still debated. The two leading explanations are that it is either a title denoting his father Vlad Dracul’s membership in the Order of the Dragon, or it is a derivation of the Romanian term <i>drac </i>with the meaning “son of the Devil.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The earliest Old Russian version of Vlad the Impaler’s life dates to 1486, when an Orthodox Monk, Efrosin, copied the story into one of his notebooks. There is no consensus on the origin of the story, but it is accepted that Efrosin’s is the earliest surviving copy. Specialists hypothesize that he could have received the source text from the infamous 15th-century Muscovite diplomat and heretic Fedor Kuritsyn. Kuritsyn could have taken the story from the court of the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. Others argue that Kuritsyn’s brother, Ivan Volk Kuritsyn, translated the story and passed it on to Efrosin. We know for sure that Efrosin’s rendition is the first Russian/East Slavic narrative of Vlad the Impaler’s devious deeds.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Efrosin’s manuscript demonstrates the diverse reading and writing culture of the Russian Orthodox monks at the Kirillov-Beloozersky (St. Cyril-Beloozero) monastery in northern Russia. Efrosin became a focus of Soviet and Russian medievalists when his collection of religious and secular texts was transferred from the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and placed in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg in 1918 (then the Russian Public Library). The manuscript in which “Dracula” is found is one of only six miscellanies that have survived to the present day from Efrosin’s library. The manuscript represents the secular and private writings of the monk whom scholars describe as the monastery’s “academic bookman.” Efrosin’s considerable personal collection of writings includes multiple secular tales. Furthermore, Robert Romanchuk, a specialist in philology, has argued that Efrosin’s secular manuscripts are unique and represent an “individual with an interest in ‘forbidden knowledge,” rather than an overarching intellectual trend among the Orthodox monks in the monastery. Another example of Efrosin’s interest in forbidden knowledge is is “The Tale of Solomon and Kitovras,” which was later added to the same notebook.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Introduction to the Source</h2>
<p>The “Tale of Dracula” was produced in 1490 in the Kirillov-Beloozersky monastery near Beloozero (Belozersk), Russia. The monk Efrosin adapted the text from an unknown source. At the end of the text, he notes that he wrote an earlier version of the story in 1486 and rewrote it in 1490 (the 1486 version has not survived). The “Tale” is part of a 500-folio manuscript codex in which Efrosin copied secular tales and diverse texts of encyclopedic content. Scholars consider the “Tale” one of the first historical novels in Russian literature. Some believe that this text, along with Efrosin’s other writings, shows a Renaissance-like movement in Russian Orthodox religious culture in the late 15th century. The book in which the “Tale” is included is one of only seven surviving manuscripts by Efrosin. They are held in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. For the text’s transcription and translation, I have used digital copies of the original manuscript #11/1088, fond 351, folio pages 204-217 of the Efrosin Collection at the Russian National Library.</p>

<h2>About this Edition</h2>
<p>The transcription retains the original elements of the manuscript. The goal of the transcription is to render the manuscript as closely as possible, including the superscript letters, abbreviations, spelling errors, and punctuation. Efrosin relied on commas, periods, and diacritic marks on certain letters to mark the beginning of a new word. Personal and geographic names have been translated in the context of 15th-century history. I referenced Matei Cazacu’s monograph Dracula to verify these names.</p>

<p>There was in the Muntenian1 land, a Christian voivode2 of the Greek faith named Dracula in the Wallachian tongue, but in ours, the Devil3. His life was so wicked, like his name. Once, ambas-sadors from the Turkish tsar came to him. And when they came in they lowered their heads according to their custom, but they did not take off their caps from their heads. And he asked them, “Why did you do that – you came to a great lord and you subject-ed me to such humiliation?” And they responded, “Such, Mas-ter, is the custom of our land.” He said to them, “And I want to confirm your custom so that you may observe it firmly.” And he commanded that their caps be nailed to their heads with small metal spikes. And he released them and said, “Go and explain to your master: if he is used to enduring humiliation from you, we are not used to it. And let him not send his custom to other rulers, who do not want to have it, but let him keep it to himself.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And the tsar was very angry about this and set off against Dracula with his army, and came against him with considerable forces. He [Dracula], having gathered as much of his own army as he had, attacked the Turks at night and killed a great num-ber of them. But not being able withstand a great army with so few people, Dracula turned back. And he began to examine those who came with him from the battle; to those wounded in the front, he gave great honor and bestowed knighthood, but he commanded those wounded from behind to be impaled on a stake, saying, “You are not a man, but a woman.” And when he went to the Turks again, he said to all his warriors: “He who thinks about death, let him not go with me, but remain here.” Having heard that, the tsar went away with great shame; having lost countless of his army, he dared not go against Dracula.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Цр҇ь же поклисарѧ посла к немоу да емоу даⷭ҇ дань. дракоула же велми почⷭ҇ᲅи поклисарѧ ѡноⷢ҇. и показа емоу все свое имѣнїе, и ре҇ⷱ емоу, азъ не ᲅокмо хощоу дань даваᲅи цр҇ю, но сⷪ всѣмъ своимъ воинсᲅвоⷨ҇ и со всею казною хощоу к немоу иᲅи на слоуⷤ҇боу. да како ми повелиᲅъ, ᲅако емоу служоу. и ᲅы, возвѣсᲅи цр҇ю какъ поидоу к немоу, да не велиᲅь ц҇рь по своеи земли никоего зла оучꙵниᲅи мнѣ, и моимъ людеⷨ҇. а ꙗзъ скⷪро хощоу по ᲅебѣ ко цр҇ю иᲅи. и дань принесоу и самъ к немꙋ (// 206r) прїидоу. ц҇рь же оуслыша҇ ⷡ ᲅо ѿ посла своего чᲅо дракоула хоще прїиᲅи к немоу на службоу. и посла еⷢ҇ почⷭ҇ᲅи и ѡдари много. и велми раⷣ быⷭ҇ бѣ бо ᲅогаⷣ раᲅоуѧсѧ со восᲅочными.</p>
<p>And the tsar sent an ambassador to demand tribute from him. And Dracula received that ambassador with great honor, and showed to him all his possessions, and said to him, “I not only want to give tribute to the tsar, but with all my army and all my coffers, I want to go into his service. And as he commands me, so I will serve him. And you, tell the tsar this: when I go to him, let him command that no evil will be done to me or my people in his land. I will go to the tsar soon, following you, and I will bring him the tribute and come to him myself.” The tsar, hearing this from his envoy, that Dracula wanted to come to him in service, bestowed honors and many gifts upon his envoy. And he was very glad because he was then waging war in the east.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>и елико ѡно времѧ пребыⷭ҇. никᲅо҇ⷤ смѣаше ᲅоу чароу взѧᲅи. (//207v) Единоюⷤ҇ поусᲅи по всеи земли свое велѣнїе, да кᲅо сᲅаръ иⷧ҇ немощенъ, иⷧ҇ чимъ вреденъ иⷧ҇ нищъ, вси да прїидоу к немоу. и собрашаⷭ҇ бесчисленое мно҇ⷤⷤьсᲅвⷪ нищиⷯⷯ҇ и сᲅранныⷯ҇ к немоу чающе ѿ него великїа млᲅⷭ҇и. ѡн же повелѣ собраᲅи всⷯⷯ҇ѣ во единоу храминꙋ, великоу на ᲅо оусᲅроеноу. и повелѣ даᲅи имъ ꙗсᲅи и пиᲅи доволно, ѡниⷤⷤ҇ ꙗдше и возвеселишаⷭ҇. ѡн же са҇ⷨⷨ приде к нимъ и гл҇а имъ чᲅо еще ᲅребоуеᲅе. ѡниⷤⷤ҇ вси ѿвѣщаша вѣдае гдр҇ю вг҇ъ и ᲅвое величесᲅво, как ᲅѧ б҇ъ вразоуми. ѡн же гл҇а к ниⷨ҇ хощеᲅе ли да соᲅворю ваⷭ҇ беспечалны на сеⷨ҇ свѣᲅѣ, и ничиⷨ҇ же ноужни боудеᲅе. ѡниⷤ҇ чающе ѿ него велико нѣчᲅо. и гл҇аша (//208r) вси хощемъ гдр҇ю.</p>
<p>And the tsar sent a message to all the cities across the land so that when Dracula went through, no one should cause him any harm, but instead should honor him. And Dracula set off, having assembled his entire army, and the tsar’s wardens accompa-nied him and greatly honored him. And he passed through the tsar’s land [Turkish land] for five days, and suddenly turned back and began to capture towns and villages. And Dracula captured and killed great multitudes: some Turks he impaled on a stake, and others he cut in half and burned, including suckling infants. He left nothing, emptying the entire land, and those who were Christians he drove to his land and resettled. And he returned, having seized a great multitude of riches and, having honored the wardens, he let them go, saying: “Go tell your tsar what you saw – I served him as much as I could, and if my service pleas-es him, I am ready to serve him this way again, as much as I can.” And the tsar could do nothing against him but was defeat-ed with shame.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And he [Dracula] hated the evil in his own land so much that if anyone committed any crime, theft, robbery, lie or injury, he would not live. Whether he be a noble boyar4, a priest, a monk, or a commoner, even if he had great wealth, still he could not ransom himself from death. And that is how formidable Drac-ula was. There was a well and its spring in his land, and many routes from many lands converged at this spring and well. And many people arrived and drank the cold and sweet water from the well and spring. He took (moved) the well to an empty space and there he placed a large, beautiful golden goblet, and anyone who wanted to drink the water could drink from the goblet in that set place.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And much time passed, but no one there dared take the gob-let. Once he sent an order across his lands that all who were old, weak, crippled, or poor, should come to him. And innumer-able multitudes of the poor and wayfarers gathered before him awaiting his great mercy. He commanded them all to assem-ble in one great house. And he commanded that they be giv-en enough to eat and to drink. They feasted and rejoiced. He came to them and said: “What more do you require?” They all answered him: “God knows, Master, Your Majesty, as God will instruct you.” He said to them, “So you want me to make you happy in this world, and you would need nothing more?” They expected nothing grand from him and all said, “This is what we want, Master.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>ѡн же повeлѣ запереᲅи хра҇ⷨⷨ и зажещи ѡгнеⷨ҇, и вси</p>

<p>He commanded that the building be locked up and set on fire, and all those who were there burned. And he said to his boyars, “And now you know why I did this. And there will be no one poor in my land, but all (will be) rich. Second, I emancipated them so that no one of this world would suffer from poverty or from illness.”</p>

<p>Once two Latin [Catholic] monks came to him from the Hungar-ian lands for alms. He ordered them to separate. And he sum-moned one of them to him; he showed him around the court-yard—the innumerable number of people on stakes and on the wheel—and asked him: “Did I do well? How are those on the stake?” He [the monk] said, “No, Master, you do evil and punish without mercy. A master ought to be merciful. But you on the wheel are martyrs.” Dracula summoned the other and asked him the same. He answered: “You, Master, are placed from God to excessively punish evildoers, and to grieve those who do good. But you carry out your accepted deeds in excess.” He [Dracula] summoned the first [monk] and said to him: “Why did you come from the monastery and from your cell to a great master, not knowing anything? And now the same will be said: that you are a martyr. I want you to be made a martyr, and you will be a martyr with them.” And he commanded him to be put on the stake but ordered the other to be given 50 gold ducats, saying: “You are a knowledgeable man.” He ordered him into the cart and to be lead away with honor to the Hungarian land.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once a merchant guest came to his town from the Hungarian lands. According to his [Dracula’s] instructions, he [the mer-chant] left his own cart in the street in front of the palace and his goods in the cart, while he slept in the palace. And some-one came and stole 160 ducats of gold from the cart. And the merchant went to Dracula and told him about the loss of the gold. Dracula then said to him, “Go, and tonight you will dis-cover the gold.” And he commanded that the thief be searched for through the entire town, saying, “If the thief is not found, I will destroy the entire town.” And he ordered his own gold to be brought and put in the cart at night, and he added one piece of gold. The merchant got up and discovered the gold and after he counted it once and twice he found one extra piece of gold. And he went to Dracula and said, “Master, I found the gold and this is one extra piece of gold that is not mine.” And at the same time, the thief was brought in with the gold. And Dracula said to the merchant, “Go in peace; if you had not told me about the [extra] gold, I was going to impale you with the thief on the stake.”</p>

<p>If any wife committed adultery against her husband, he [Dracu-la] would order them to cut out her shame5 and rip off her skin and bind her naked, and her skin would be put on a pillar in the middle of town to be hung up in the marketplace. Dracula ordered the same be done to a virgin whose virginity was not protected; and in the case of widows, their breasts cut off. In other cases, they ripped off the skin from the woman’s shame, and brought hot irons which they thrust into her shame and out of her mouth. And thus, she would stand, bound naked to the pillar, until her body and bones fell apart or she became food</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once Dracula was being driven along the road and noticed a poor man and asked him whether he had a wife. He answered: “I do, Master.” Dracula then said: “Bring me to your home, so I can see.” And he beheld his young and healthy wife, and said to her husband: “Do you sow linen?” He answered: “Master, I have many linens.” And he showed him the many linens. And Dracula said to the wife, “Why do you show idleness toward your own husband? He must sow and plough and protect you. And you must make your husband light and decent clothing. But you do not want to make him shirts, though your body is healthy. You are guilty, but not your husband. If your husband did not sow linen, then your husband would be guilty.” And he commanded her hand chopped off and her corpse put on the stake.</p>

<p>Sometimes he dined under the corpses of the dead, who were impaled on the stake, a number [of them] around his table. He ate in the middle of them and took delight [in it]. His servant, having placed [the food] in front of him to eat, could not endure the stench and shut his nose and turned his head to the side. Dracula asked him “Why did you do that?” He answered: “Mas-ter, I can not endure the stench.” Dracula then commanded him to be impaled on the stake, saying: “There you dwell so high, the stench cannot reach you.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Another time an ambassador from the Hungarian King Matthi-as6 came to him; the person was a noble boyar7, a Pole by birth. And he commanded him to sit with him for dinner in the middle of the corpses. And before them lay one thick, golden, and high stake, and Dracula asked the ambassador, “Tell me, why did I make the stake this way?” The envoy was very frightened and said: “Master, I assume thus: a great person before you sinned. And you want to make his death more honorable than others’.” Dracula said: “You spoke correctly, you are an envoy of a great master. This stake is prepared for you.”</p>

<p>He answered, “Master, if I have done something suitable for death, do as you wish. Righteous is your judgement. You are not guilty of my death, but I am.” Dracula laughed and said: “If you had not answered me truthfully, you would have been on that same stake.” He showed him great honor and released him, saying, “You justly go in embassy from a great master to a great master. You know how to speak with great rulers. The rest will not dare8. But first they will be taught how to converse with great masters.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dracula had such a custom that when an unrefined envoy came to him, from a tsar or king and did not know how to answer his cunning [questions], then he was impaled on the stake, saying: “I am not guilty of your death, or your master,” “or you yourself. But say nothing ill about me. If your master, knowing you are unwise and uneducated, sent you here to me, to a wise master, then your master killed you; if you brought yourself, unprepared, then you killed yourself.” Thus (he) arranged for the ambassa-dor the highly gilded stake and impaled him on it, and sent a complaint to his master with another (envoy) so that the ruler would not send a wise leader an unwise and uneducated man as an ambassador.</p>

<p>The craftsmen made iron cisterns for him; Dracula filled them with gold and placed them in the river. And Dracula commanded those craftsmen killed so that no one who carried out the deceit would take them, only he of the same name as the devil9.</p>

<p>Once the Hungarian King Matthias went against him with his warriors. Dracula met with him, went against him, and both fought, and he [Matthias] captured Dracula alive, handed over by his own [men] in an act of treachery. Dracula was brought to the king, and he commanded him to be thrown in prison. And he was there in Visegrad10 on the Danube, four miles past Buda, for twelve years. And another voivode11 sat in the Wallachian land. When this voivode died, the king went to him [Dracula] in pris-on12, and [said] if he wanted to be the voivode in the Wallachian lands, he would first accept the Latin faith.</p>

<p>If not, then he wanted to die in prison. Dracula desired the tem-porary pleasure of this world, rather than the eternal and infinite [pleasure of the afterlife], and retreated from Orthodoxy. And [he] shrank back from the truth and left the light to go into the darkness. Alas, unable to bear the temporary burden of prison, and ready for infinite torment, he left our Orthodox faith</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The king not only gave him the voivodship in the Wallachian lands, but he gave him his own birth sister as a wife; from her two sons were born. Dracula lived a brief time, ten years, and was tortured in his deceit. They say about him, that sitting in prison, he did not repudiate his wicked customs, but caught mice and bought birds at the market and tortured them. Either [he] put them on the stake or cut off their heads, and from oth-ers plucked out the feathers. He learned how to sow, and so fed himself in prison.</p>

<p>When the king liberated him from the prison and summoned him to Buda, he gave him a home in Pest opposite Buda. But he was not at the king’s court. It happened that some criminal went into his [Dracula’s] courtyard and hid there. Hunters arrived and began to search for [the criminal] and came upon him. Dracula got up, took his sword, galloped from the palace, and cut off the head of the steward who had held the criminal, but released the criminal. The other escaped and came to an administrative official and told him what occurred. The administrative official, along with all the princes, went to the king to lament about Dracula. The King questioned him: “Why did you do such evil?” Dracula then answered that no one could commit a wicked act, without Dracula killing the wrongdoer himself. Approaching the robber in the great master’s home, he killed him. “If he [the stew-ard] had come to me and announced [what happened], then I would have found a criminal in my own house or handed [him] over, or set him free from death (not have killed him).” He was brought to the King. The King began to laugh and marveled at his courage.</p>

<p>Dracula’s end was thus: he lived in the Wallachian land, and the Turks attacked his land, and began to take prisoners. He struck them and defeated the Turks. Dracula’s army began to cut them down without mercy. Dracula, in joy, rode up the hill to see the Turks cut down. And [he] pulled away from his army, which, close to him, assumed he was a Turk and one of them hit him with a lance. Dracula, seeing that he had been wounded, then killed his own murderer with his sword. Five more lances pierced him, and thus he died.</p>

<p>The King took his sister, along with the two sons, to Buda in the Hungarian land. One son lived under the king. The other was a bishop in Varndinsky and died among us; a third son, the eldest, Mikhail, they saw there in Bud, running to the king from the Turk-ish tsar13. Still unmarried, Dracula had him [Mikhail] with a girl. Stefan the same Moldovan14, following the king’s will, placed in the Wallachian land a son of a voivode named Vlad15. This Vlad was the one who was alone from childhood, then a priest, and the superior in a monastery. Then [Vlad] defrocked and settled down into the voivodship and married. He took the wife of the voivode who was killed a little after Dracula. Stefan of Moldavia killed him, then took that wife. Now the voivode in the Wallachi-an land is [another] Vlad, who was a hermit and solitary. I, the sinful Efrosin, wrote the above on February 12 in the year 6994 [1486], then I rewrote it again in January 28 in the year 6998 [1490]16.</p>
