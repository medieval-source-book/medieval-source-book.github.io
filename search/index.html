    "textauthor": "Adam of St. Victor [att.]",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n This edition is based on ​​Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 253. Besides “In Honor of St. Augustine”, the manuscript contains selections from Augustine’s theological works, his Confessions, and a guide to living a Christian life for soldiers by Ferrandus, deacon of Carthage (d. 546/7). The works by Augustine are in a fine hand, with exceptional illuminated initials. “In Honor of St. Augustine” is in a twelfth-century hand and appears with musical notation on a three-line stave. There are also some late medieval additions at the end of the manuscript. \n Introduction to the Text \n “ In Honor of St. Augustine ” is a 12th-century sequence attributed to Adam of St. Victor (d. 1146), who served at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and later at the nearby Abbey of Saint Victor. As one of the most prominent authors of hymns and sequences from this period, he was acquainted with various important theologians at the time, such as Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor.  The central feature of this sequence is the image of heaven that it provides. During its performance, two groups of singers would sing the same text, with the second group starting later than the first group, creating a layered sonic effect. In this way, the images of heaven which are present in the text would be layered over one another, generating a complexity of sound and meaning which would resonate against the walls of the church or cathedral and offer an earthly simulation of heaven's beauty. One interesting aspect of the text is that it mentions specific worries which will not exist in heaven (“enemy attacks”, “mob strikes”), giving us insight into what people in twelfth century Paris were most concerned about.  This sequence is written to be sung at the feast day of St. Augustine (354-430 CE) on August 28th. St. Augustine was a prolific theologian and philosopher and by the High Middle Ages (c.1000-1250 CE) had become the most important thinker for medieval Christians in Western Europe. Some of his most notable works are The City of God, On Christian Doctrine, and his Confessions. The typical practice on Saints’ Days was for Christians to sing hymns, recite prayers and observe relics, such as fragments of the saint’s clothing or their bodily remains. “In Honor of St. Augustine” would have been incorporated into this kind of celebratory liturgy.  Liturgical music of the medieval church comprised diverse forms which each served different purposes: the antiphon, the responsorium, the sequence, etc. The sequence would be performed directly before the reading of the Gospel and after the singing of “Alleluia”. As a form, it is composed of a series of rhymed, metrical couplets of varying lengths. “In Honor of St. Augustine” was probably sung in both parish churches and monastic settings; its manuscript transmission suggests that it may even have been sung in the Middle East by Christian crusaders. It seems to have been a popular hymn, as it has come down to us in many manuscripts and was translated into several other European languages during the medieval period. \n Further Reading \n Fassler, Margot E.

This latter reading lends itself to the verse that follows, as it does the legend of al-Ḥārith’s entrance into the fight. As medieval commentators have it, the fateful day he joined the battle would be remembered as the Day of Shearing (Yawm al-Taḥāluq), or the Day of Haircutting Past the Earlobes (Yawm Taḥlāq al-Limam), on account of Bakr’s tribesmen cutting their hair in order for their women to identify them: al-Ḥārith had ordered them to attend onto the battlefield to finish off Taghlib’s wounded and nurse their own. وسَعَتْ كلُّ حُرَّة الوجهِ تدعويا لبكرٍ غرَّاءَ كالتِّمثال While freewoman raced, calling,“Bakr!”Bakr being the name of al-Ḥārith’s tribe.—honorable as idols. يا بجيرَ الخيرات لا صُلحَ حتىنملا البيد من رؤوس الرجال O opulent Bujayr,The Arabic, “Ya Bujayr al-khayrāt”, plays on the name Bujayr, which means (of a belly) “filled with water or milk”.

    "textauthor": "Abū Nuʻaym al-Iṣbahānī [att.]",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n This version of the prayer story is found only in Khalidi Library (Jerusalem) MS 214, fol. 59r-61v. The manuscript is not dated, but was likely copied around the 15th century. The elaborately decorated title page (the style may indicate that it was produced in Egypt) describes the manuscript’s contents as “a compilation that contains aphorisms and testaments and fables by Luqmān the Sage.” The texts are a miscellany of popular philosophy, including the “Testament of Pythagoras” and the “Testament of Luqmān,” in which ancient philosophers allegedly give final instructions to their disciples before their deaths. The “Fables of Luqmān,” highly similar to those of Aesop, are also included. Various other sayings attributed to ancient philosophers appear between these larger texts, along with the inscriptions that were supposedly found on the philosophers’ seals. The story of al-Shāfiʻī and his prayer is the final item in the manuscript.  At first glance, the story of the prayer is an outlier in this compilation of texts attributed to ancient philosophers, focusing on specifically Islamic characters and themes as none of the other texts do. However, we may view the entire manuscript as a collection of short texts that would be interesting and beneficial for a court official to know, collected by just such an official (perhaps in Mamlūk Egypt) with money to spend on an ornate manuscript. Pithy sayings attributed to ancient sages and entertaining animal fables with succinct moral lessons would not only be edifying for the manuscript’s owner personally, but could be useful bits of knowledge as the owner aimed to impress superiors with erudite conversation topics. This prayer (and its enjoyable frame story) fits perfectly in that court context, and so we might view this manuscript as an anthology in the tradition of adab (“etiquette”) literature, training its reader in the proper knowledge and protocols for a refined member of the upper class. The context of Khalidi MS 214 thus recasts the text to make it less about the personal sanctity of al-Shāfiʻī, as in Ḥilyat al-awliyāʼ , and more about the elite readers who might rely on this prayer for protection in a precarious world. \n Introduction to the Text \n This text is attributed to Abū Nuʻaym al-Iṣbahānī (948-1038), and indeed a shorter version of the story can be found in Abū Nuʻaym’s biographical dictionary Ḥilyat al-awliyāʼ wa-ṭabaqāt al-aṣfiyāʼ (vol. 9, pp. 78-79 in the Beirut edition), which compiles biographical accounts of many early Islamic figures. This excerpt comes from the section on the foundational early legal scholar Muḥammad al-Shāfiʻī (d. 820), its central character, but has been substantially expanded and modified from Abū Nuʻaym’s original version, itself passed down from generations of earlier narrators. Abū Nuʻaym provides full chains of transmission (X said that Y said…) to authenticate each story, although in this version, the initial chain has been abbreviated on the assumption that the reader can seek out Abū Nuʻaym’s text for more complete information.  The accounts in Ḥilyat al-awliyāʼ emphasize the sanctity of early Muslims, and this one is no exception. The story is placed in the mouth of al-Faḍl ibn al-Rabīʻ (755-824), one of the most important court officials under the ʻAbbāsid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (r. 786-809). As al-Faḍl tells the story, he was summoned before the angry caliph one night and asked to produce al-Shāfiʻī for likely torture and/or execution. The reason for the caliph’s anger is not stated, but there is a historical nucleus to this event, for al-Shāfiʻī was nearly executed in 803, while he was governor of the rebellious city of Najrān. Different explanations have been given for the scholar’s narrow escape, including this account, which attributes his salvation to his pious recitation of a prayer at court. Through another, more complete chain of transmission, al-Shāfiʻī tells al-Faḍl that this prayer was recited by the Prophet Muḥammad during the Battle of the Trench (626-627) and contributed to the Muslims’ victory. Note that this connection to the Prophet is not found in Ḥilyat al-awliyāʼ , where the prayer is simply attributed to al-Shāfiʻī, but the expanded version amplifies its prestige. This text reflects the precarious, yet often luxurious, life of a powerful court official: you may be summoned before the caliph for torture, or you may instead receive more gold than you could ever need. One strategy for dealing with this precarity, as seen here, is to rely on the protection of God and recite this prayer each time the ruler calls your name.  As you read the text, note some of the distinctive features of classical Islamic texts, including:    The chain of transmission (isnād), already discussed, that provides authority for stories and sayings attributed to earlier figures. This text includes one incomplete chain and one complete chain.    Formulas of respect placed after the names of ..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This excerpt is taken from a much longer text known as the Kitāb al-Ilmām bi-l-’alam fi ma jarat bihi al-aḥkām wa al-amūr al-maqḍiya fi waq’at al-Iskandariya (“Book of Gleanings Related to What Happened in the Events of the Fall of Alexandria”), hereafter referred to as the Kitab al-Ilmam ). The author is Muhammad ibn Qāsim ibn Muhammad al-Nuwayrī al-Iskandarāniyy (hereafter referred to as al-Nuwayri al-Iskandarani). The text was written prior to his death in 1372 CE / 775 H and this excerpt makes up about only two and a half percent of the total length of the extensive critical text. This excerpt of the Kitāb al-Ilmām provides a graphic account of the catastrophic sack of Alexandria at the hands of Cypriot and Western armies in 1365 and the selling of many Alexandrians into slavery, but as the title of the work suggests, the author gleans a significant amount of other detail from his immediate surroundings, lending this translation an intriguing, yet disturbing, character.   Al-Nuwayri al-Iskandarani wrote in the general context of the political instability of the Bahri Mamluk period, and he explored many topics of interest to the social and cultural historian of the medieval Mediterranean. The narrative of the sack of the city cites numerous eyewitness accounts from a cast of residents of Alexandria, as it constructs a critique of the tactical choices made to protect the city against the siege. The text has much to offer literary historians, since the author was a copyist of Arabic manuscripts for the rich merchants of Alexandria and his extensive knowledge from manuscript collections makes its way into his account of the sack of Alexandria: anecdotes and citations of Arabic poetry--including an excerpt from Ibn Zaydun's famous “Nūniyya” poem at the very end--as well as poetry composed for the occasion in a variety of genres: praise, elegy and satire. The events of the raid on Alexandria are repeatedly linked to the history of early Islam and al-Andalus (for example, the battle of Uhud and the fall of Lorca), but also to fascinating interpolations on the stratagems of war from the legendary correspondence of Alexander the Great and Aristotle, including using birds as incendiary weapons and building armies of automata. In this partial translation, al-Nuwayri al-Iskandarani touches on the origin of the peoples of Alexandria, he provides vivid examples of martyrdom in the face of violence and punctuates his account with a providential explanation for the fall of the city. Particularly striking are the vivid descriptions of the material and architectural richness of the city of Alexandria, its mosques, markets and fortifications in the fourteenth century.  Maps of the medieval Arab city are rare, let alone with locations marked on them, but fol. 302a of Walters ms 658 of Piri Reis's Kitāb-i baḥriye gives some idea of the layout of the city from the post-raid perspective the 1550s.  Since Atiya, the Kitab al-Ilmam has been known as the most significant eyewitness account in Arabic of the sack of Alexandria, and yet materials in translation from the other languages of the period of the “late crusades,” such as Turkish and Arabic are generally missing. The sack of Alexandria is but one of a number of raids led by King Peter I of Cyprus on coastal cities of the eastern Mediterranean: Korikos (1360), Antalya (1363), Alexandria (1365), Tripoli (1367), Latakia (1368). Where as Western European treatment of King Peter, as we find in Guillaume de Machaut's Prise d’Alixandre and Geoffrey Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale and Monk’s Tale ) gloss over the violence and material greed of such raids, this translated excerpt provides readers with the unique vantage point of a Muslim perspective on the sack of Alexandria, as well as a glimpse of both intercultural contact and material culture of the period. \n Further Reading \n Atiya, Aziz Souryal.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n “Let the days do as they please” comes from the collected poems ascribed to Muḥammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī, better known as al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī (d. 820). We have no extant manuscripts from his period that include his poetic works, which appeared in various anthologies since the Middle Ages. Only relatively recently, at the turn of the twentieth century, was the poetry ascribed to him published in a single dīwān , or poetry collection. These poems were penned by different hands at different points in history. In the preface to his second edition of the Dīwān, Dr. Mujāhid Bahjat notes that the majority of poems ascribed to al-Shāfiʿī may be ascribed to other poets or are otherwise unconfirmed as his own; he traces only twelve directly to him, whereas a given edition may include over 160 poems and poetic fragments (Bahjat 3-4, 19-20).  Although primarily recognized as the namesake to one of the four main jurisprudential schools (or madhāhib , sg. madh'hab ) in Sunni Islam, al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī equally distinguished himself as a master of language and adab (belles-lettres). Growing up, this descendant of the prophetic line of the Banū Hāshim tribe lived among the Hudhayl—a clan known for the purity of their Arabic—in order to immerse himself in the study of the language. This training cemented his reputation as a poet and poetic critic. Years later, in Baghdad, the famed philologist and grammarian al-Aṣmaʿī (d. 828) would visit al-Shāfiʿī to take Hudhalī poetry from him. As did all eminent scholars who sought him out (there were many), al-Aṣmaʿī marveled at his double command of language and poetry.  al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī was born in Gaza in 767. With the death of his father, he and his mother moved to Mecca two years later. His pursuit of knowledge (or ṭalab al-ʿilm) brought him at a young age to Medina, where he studied ḥadīth (prophetic narrations) and fiqh (Islamic law) under al-Imām Mālik ibn Anas until the latter’s death in 795. He then accepted a post in Yemen as governor of Najran, although a revolt in 803 prematurely ended his political career when it led to his arrest and summoning to the court of the Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (d. 809) in al-Raqqah, a city in Syria. There, he would meet the jurist Muḥammad al-Shaybānī (d. 805), who helped secure his acquittal. Under al-Imām al-Shaybānī’s tutelage, al-Shāfiʿī relocated to Baghdad. (Among al-Shāfiʿī’s most important students there was al-Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal (d. 855)). al-Shāfiʿī would make one more major move in 814 to Egypt, where he continued to study and teach a variety of subjects, primarily jurisprudence, until his death in 820 at the age of 54.  The verses ascribed to al-Shāfiʿī probably reflect a lifetime’s worth of occasional compositions and pronouncements, and certainly reflect their author’s erudition, fine manners, and familiarity with classical meters. Precise and brief, the poetry nevertheless employs a range of sophisticated rhetorical strategies, from ṭibāq (contrariety) to bayān (eloquence), to jinās (paronomasia), to additional instances of badīʿ (ingenuity)—stylistically unique tropes and schemes (Bahjat 29-37, 42-43).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n “Your friend contests whomever you contest” comes from the collected works ascribed to Muḥammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī, better known as al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī (d. 820). The great belletrist ʿAbd al-Mālik al-Thaʿālibī (d. 1038) marshals these verses in blame of friendship in his famous anthology, Yāwāqīt al-Mawāqīt fī Madḥ Kull Shayʾ wa-Dhammihi wa-Tazyīnihi wa-Tahjīnihi  ( Rubies of the Ages in Praise, Blame, Adornment, and Debasement of Everything) , alternatively titled al-Laṭāʾif   wa-al-  Ẓ  arāʾif   ( The Subtle and Eloquent [Expressions]) . The anthology bespeaks an age's incessant knack for wit. With the right evidence, eloquence, and sense of humor, authors absurdly uglified the beautiful and beautified the ugly.  We have no extant manuscripts from his period that include al-Shāfiʿī's poetic works, which appeared in various anthologies since the Middle Ages. Only relatively recently, at the turn of the twentieth century, was the poetry ascribed to him published in a single dīwān , or poetry collection. These poems were penned by different hands at different points in history. In the preface to his second edition of the Dīwān, Dr. Mujāhid Bahjat notes that the majority of poems ascribed to al-Shāfiʿī may be ascribed to other poets or are otherwise unconfirmed as his own; he traces only twelve directly to him, whereas a given edition may include over 160 poems and poetic fragments (Bahjat 3-4, 19-20).  Although primarily recognized as the namesake to one of the four main jurisprudential schools (or madhāhib , sg. madh'hab ) in Sunni Islam, al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī equally distinguished himself as a master of language and adab (belles-lettres). Growing up, this descendant of the prophetic line of the Banū Hāshim tribe lived among the Hudhayl—a clan known for the purity of their Arabic—in order to immerse himself in the study of the language. This training made his reputation as a poet and poetic critic. Years later, in Baghdad, the famed philologist and grammarian al-Aṣmaʿī (d. 828) would visit al-Shāfiʿī to take Hudhalī poetry from him. As did all eminent scholars who sought him out (there were many), he marveled at al-Shāfiʿī's double command of language and poetry.  al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī was born in Gaza in 767. With the death of his father, he and his mother moved to Mecca two years later. His pursuit of knowledge (or ṭalab al-ʿilm) brought him at a young age to Medina, where he studied ḥadīth (prophetic narrations) and fiqh (Islamic law) under al-Imām Mālik ibn Anas until the latter’s death in 795. He then accepted a post in Yemen as governor of Najran, although a revolt in 803 prematurely ended his political career when it led to his arrest and summoning to the court of the Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (d.809) in al-Raqqah, a city in Syria. There, he would meet the jurist Muḥammad al-Shaybānī (d.805), who helped secure his acquittal. Under al-Imām al-Shaybānī’s tutelage, al-Shāfiʿī relocated to Baghdad. (Among al-Shāfiʿī’s most important students there was al-Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal (d. 855 )). al-Shāfiʿī would make one more major move in 814 for Egypt, where he continued to study and teach a variety of subjects, primarily jurisprudence, until his death in 820 at the age of 54.  The verses ascribed to al-Shāfiʿī probably reflect a lifetime’s worth of occasional compositions and pronouncements, and certainly reflect their author’s erudition, fine manners, and familiarity with classical meters. Precise and brief, the poetry nevertheless employs a range of sophisticated rhetorical strategies, from ṭibāq (contrariety) to bayān (eloquence), to jinās (paronomasia), to additional instances of badīʿ (ingenuity)—stylistically unique tropes and schemes (Bahjat 29-37, 42-43). Thematically, the poems touch on the matters of wisdom literature, including personal comportment, friendship, the pursuit of knowledge, and the cultivation of virtues. \n Further Reading \n Bahjat, Mujāhid M. “Muqaddimat al-Ṭabʿah al-Thāniyah” (“Preface to the Second Edition”).

    "textauthor": "Alcuin",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The poem is preserved in a single manuscript, Paris, BNF, lat. 528 . The manuscript is a complex compendium of poetic, grammatical and rhetorical texts, most notably including numerous epistles and poems by Paul the Deacon (d. 799). It is believed to have been compiled in Saint-Denis (near Paris) during the abbacy of Fardulf (793–806). Fardulf’s predecessor, Fulerad, is the last person addressed in Alcuin’s poem, which suggests that the “little letter” did in fact make the journey on which Alcuin sent it. It can certainly be dated to the first half of the ninth century on palaeographical grounds. By the eleventh century it had moved to the Abbey of Saint Martial in Limoges (in west-central France); it was transferred to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France at Paris in 1730. \n Introduction to the Text \n Alcuin (c.735–804 AD) was one of the leading figures in the so-called “Carolingian Renaissance” – the renewal or reinvigoration of education and literary/artistic production during the reign of Charlemagne (r.768–814) over the Frankish kingdom in Western Europe (encompassing much of modern France, Germany, the Low Countries and northern Italy). Alcuin was originally from York in Northumbria (what is now the North of England). He was educated at the Cathedral school in York, where he became known as a master of the liberal arts.  In c.780, he traveled to Rome to receive the pallium (a sign of papal authority) for Eanbald, Archbishop of York, meeting Charlemagne for the first time on his return journey (later in the decade, he would be invited to move permanently to Charlemagne’s court, where he began his task of educational and literal renewal). On his return to England, he is believed to have written this short Latin poem, “Cartula perge cito” (“Go quickly, little letter”). It was likely composed no later than 782, since it addresses Bassinus, who ceased to be bishop of Speyer in this year. In this poem, he sends a letter of greetings to the people he met on the way to and/or from Rome. The central conceit of the poem is that Alcuin addresses (or “apostrophizes”) the letter itself, telling it to make its way down the Rhine river from Utrecht, through Cologne, to Charlemagne’s court (which was itinerant at this point, with no fixed capital), and on to Mainz, Speyer and finally to Saint-Denis (in an odd departure from the route). Given the detail of the description of the places on the way, it seems probable that the letter is following Alcuin’s own journey – for a traveler coming from the North of England, the Rhine would have been a relatively quick and safe route for travel into Italy and onto Rome.  Travel literature per se is relatively rare in the early Middle Ages. As such, this poem offers remarkable insight into a major trading and pilgrimage route – the journey itself and the places and people encountered along the way. The letter’s (or Alcuin’s) arrival in Frisia is particularly striking for its treatment of the issue of lodging – the need for the traveler (in the days before travel agents and Airbnb!) to find accommodation and food on what would have been a long, uncertain journey. It is easy to imagine why Alcuin would warn travelers off the grim merchant Hrotberht in the bustling trading emporium of Dorestad – one imagines there were plenty of unwelcoming and unsavory inns and hostelries to contend with on such a journey. Elsewhere there are other charming details, like Alcuin’s fear that his gift of a grammatical manuscript might end up at the bottom of the sea.  The poem is written in dactylic hexameters, the same meter used by Virgil, and the most common form of Latin verse in the early Middle Ages; it had previously been used by Alcuin’s great English predecessors, Aldhelm and Bede. Other Latin poets had used the conceit of a letter – most notably Sidonius Apollinaris’s Carmen 24, in which he sends his liber on a journey from Clermont to Narbonne. Sidonius, like Alcuin, divided his poem into a series of “frames” which fragment the letter’s itinerarium (journey) into a series of vignettes. In terms of style, the poem is also reminiscent of Virgil’s Eclogues, a series of relatively short pastoral pieces on a variety of subjects. Although little in the poem is “pastoral” in the strictest sense (there is no shepherd to be found, although there is a “cow-lord bishop”), Alcuin nevertheless evokes a world of rich produce, of “flower-filled fields” and calm rivers, a world in which one does not merely introduce oneself, but “knocks on the doors with Castalian lyre.” Alcuin quotes from Eclogue 8 in the poem, perhaps as a signal to learned readers that he was operating in this mode. At the same time, there are also echoes of Roman satire (especially Horace) in Alcuin’s playful, prodding addresses to his friends. \n Further Reading \n Bullough, Donald A.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The  “ Roman des Franceis ”  appears in London, British Library, MS Add. 10289 , fols. 129v-132v. The manuscript was likely made in Mont-Saint-Michel in the late 13th century (Paris and Bos 1885, xix–xxiv; see also the BL manuscript notice), and besides the Roman des Franceis, it contains a number of other texts, listed by Paris and Bos. Some texts have a connection to the manuscript’s place of production, such as ours and Guillaume de Saint-Pair’s Roman du Mont-Saint-Michel, while others are less place-specific. The text of the  “ Roman des Franceis ”  is at times rather obscure, in all likelihood due to the vagaries of transmission. It has been edited by Achille Jubinal (1842, vol 2, 1–17), and more recently and with substantial improvements by Anthony Holden (1973). The GMS translation is based on an interpretive transcription of the Roman des Franceis, and occasionally draws on Holden’s edition, commentary or glossary to establish a legible text, where necessary. \n Introduction to the Text \n The  “ Roman des Franceis, ”  also known as  “ Arflet, ”  is a short satirical piece in octosyllabic verses, arranged in four-line strophes. Its author, who names himself André (361, 371, 385, 395), has been confirmed by Gaston Paris to be André de Coutances, the Norman who is known as the author of an Évangile de Nicodème (Paris and Bos 1885, xvi–xix, xxiv–xxvii). It should be noted, however, that the attribution is hypothetical. Given its subject matter and the views expressed therein, it has been suggested that the Roman des Franceis could not have been written after 1204, when Philippe-Auguste invaded Normandy.   The  “ Roman des Franceis ”  is presented as a charter issued by Alfred, king of Northumberland. It takes a biting stance towards the French, who are depicted as cowardly, stingy, and poor garlic-eating wretches. First, it stages the invasion of France by King Arthur (41-224), during which Arthur defeats Frollo, king of the French, in a duel (173-192) and throws the French into serfdom after the latter’s defeat (193-208). André then goes on to describe the stinginess of the French: to avoid petty fighting over food, they developed the tradition of tying pieces of bread to strings, allowing them to retrieve their share of soup (237-312; this motif has been studied by Félix Lecoy [1970]), and they have their guests pay for their share of food (345-360). The  “ Roman des Franceis ”  also includes a series of burlesque commandments proffered by Frollo (137-156). While the text chiefly targets the French, the English get their share of satirical observations too, heavy drinkers as they are (5-15). It should be noted that when the text refers to  “ the French, ”  it might be refering to the inhabitants of the small royal domain surrounding Paris (see 62-64). At the time it was likely written, half of what we know as France was under Plantagenet rule, while the other half was only nominally subject to the king of France. The list of names at the end of the poem (386-396), as well as the list of peers of France, copied in Latin after the Roman and transcribed here, attests to this. \n Further Reading \n Catalog notice for Add.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n Bar ‘Ebroyo’s poetry is largely undated, and relatively little has been written about it, although he wrote over 300 poems on topics as diverse as those found in his prose corpus. His poetry exists in several manuscripts, but there has been no critical edition published that includes an  apparatus and discussion of the manuscripts. Two collections have been published, the one I have used for this poem (Dolabani) and an earlier one by Augustinus Scebabi (1877). In Dolabani's collection, the poems are grouped by subject, and this poem is the first a section that focuses on the theme of nature. \n Introduction to the Text \n This poem by Maphrian Mor Gregorios Bar ‘Ebroyo (1226-1286) is from a collection of his poems ( musḥotho ) compiled by Mor Philoxenos Yuhanon Dolabani in 1929 and republished by the Mor Ephrem Monastery in Glane, Holland in 1983. Bar ‘Ebroyo (also latinized as Bar Hebraeus) was a prolific author who wrote on topics ranging from astronomy, medicine, theology, poetry, grammar, canon law, and more. He wrote in Arabic and Syriac and many of works are translations of earlier Arabic works, or at least rely heavily upon such works. As maphrian, Bar ‘Ebroyo oversaw the eastern half of the Syriac Orthodox Church, with his seat being in the Mor Matay Monastery, near Mosul, Iraq. This office was second only to the patriarch of Antioch, although in function the two were largely equal.  The title of this poem implies that the month of April ( nisan , in Syriac) is the subject of the author’s praise, yet the rose is really the recipient of the panegyric. The author seems to be alluding to the popular Arabic genre of the disputation poem, where two or more inanimate objects, animals, or even abstract concepts are anthropomorphized and debate their qualities. The rose and narcissus (daffodil) flowers were common interlocutors in such poems. In this poem, the rose is heralded as the most beautiful of all flowers, but is scolded by the narrator because it allows its beauty to be plucked and used by disreputable people. The Syriac text uses a 12-syllable meter with stanzas of four lines. \n Further Reading \n Bar ‘Ebroyo. Bar Hebraeus's Mush'hotho Book . Monastery of St. Ephrem the Syrian, 1983.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The “Litany of Creation” is preserved in Dublin RIA Manuscript 23 N 10 (formerly Betham 145, Catalog 967). This manuscript was produced by three principal scribes, who signed their names simply as Aodh, Dubthach and Torna. They worked for or belonged to the Ó Maoil Chonaire, a family of professional poets and historians from Connacht. At a conference at the Royal Irish Academy in 2019, this manuscript was given a new name by scholars: the Book of Ballycummin ( Baile in Chuimine ). \n Introduction to the Text \n This Old Irish prayer comes from an early Irish text known as the “Litany of Creation”, which is preserved in a single manuscript. The “Litany of Creation” is comprised of two distinct sections.1 The first consists of numerous entreaties to God, the Trinity, and Saint Michael, and makes reference to various aspects of Creation. The second section, which is presented here, includes prayers and entreaties related to elements of the created world. It refers to a life of religious devotion aided by the powers of this prayer, which is referred to as a “Besom (or Broom) of Devotion.” The lines of the prayer describe its own powerful attributes, such as connection with and communication with the divine; spiritual comfort; beauty and awe; as well as the many forms of assistance and protection bestowed upon a person as a result of its recitation.  The image of the broom appears in several medieval Irish literary contexts. In the Life of St. Molua of Clonfertmulloe (d. circa 609), St. Molua states that unless a person has confessed their sins, they cannot obtain pardon from the Lord; for just as the floor of a house is cleaned daily with a broom, so too does the soul require the daily confession of sins in order to be made clean. The association of the broom with the cleansing of the soul is found elsewhere in the Christian literature of the Middle Ages, including the work of Theodulf of Orléans (d. 821), Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153) and Peter Cantor (d. c. 1197).  The symbol of the besom or broom was also mentioned by the prominent Irish scholar Colcu Ua Duinechda of Clonmacnoise (d. circa 795), who is credited with writing two litanies with similarities to our own. The earliest surviving manuscript which contains them was produced around 1400, in the codex now known as the Yellow Book of Lecan (Dublin TCD 1318). From this, we can discern that the image of the besom of devotion played a part in a number of early Irish manuscripts, including our intriguing text. \n Further Reading \n Meyer, Kuno [ed.][tr.], 'Stories and songs from Irish manuscripts: VI.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Facetiae seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The Facetiae was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or “conversations” were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (into Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the Facetiae seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages. \n Introduction to the Text \n Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and important humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, and travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe.  Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe.  Through his texts we also meet a very polemical man, who seems to get into fights with many of his contemporaries, the most famous of which is his conflict with another of the humanist greats, Lorenzo Valla. The collections of jokes and stories known today as the Facetiae , but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as Conversations ( Confabulationes ), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his Facetiae are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The Facetiae as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the Facetiae , Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s The Hermaphrodite , which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punchline seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader).  In this conclusion to his Facetiae , Poggio reminisces about the context in which the Facetiae came to be. \n Further Reading \n Kallendorf, Craig, “Poggio Bracciolini” in Oxford Bibliographies: DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195399301-0095   Craig Kallendorf’s article in Oxford Bibliographies is a good starting point for researching Poggio.

Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The Facetiae was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or “conversations” were translated to several other languages, either as an entire collection (translated into Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the Facetiae seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages. \n Introduction to the Text \n Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and important humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, and travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe.  Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe.  Through his texts we also meet a very polemical man, who seems to get into fights with many of his contemporaries, the most famous of which is his conflict with another of the humanist greats, Lorenzo Valla. The collections of jokes and stories known today as the Facetiae , but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as Conversations ( Confabulationes ), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his Facetiae are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The Facetiae as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the Facetiae , Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s The Hermaphrodite , which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punchline seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader).  As for Poggio’s motive with writing the Facetiae , he phrases it best himself in this text, which served as an introduction to the collection, a defense of the Facetiae and a declaration of its purpose. \n Further Reading \n Kallendorf, Craig, “Poggio Bracciolini” in Oxford Bibliographies: DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195399301-0095   Craig Kallendorf’s article in Oxford Bibliographies is a good starting point for researching Poggio.

While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his Facetiae are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The Facetiae as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the Facetiae , Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s The Hermaphrodite , which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punchline seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader).  This joke, probably the rudest in the collection, plays on the ancient theme of a stupid and greedy man being tricked. \n Further Reading \n Kallendorf, Craig, “Poggio Bracciolini” in Oxford Bibliographies: DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195399301-0095   Craig Kallendorf’s article in Oxford Bibliographies is a good starting point for researching Poggio.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Facetiae seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The Facetiae was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or “conversations” were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (into Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the Facetiae seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages. \n Introduction to the Text \n Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and important humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, and travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe.  Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe.

This joke represents a category of stories in the collection, which are closer to aphorisms than jokes. \n Further Reading \n Kallendorf, Craig, “Poggio Bracciolini” in Oxford Bibliographies: DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195399301-0095   Craig Kallendorf’s article in Oxford Bibliographies is a good starting point for researching Poggio.

Here is the information in the letters, and clearer than what the Brut says about the death of king Arthur, and it distinguishes truth from false stories and riddles. Let the readers know that here are two chapters made known to them from our book, the one which is called Mirror of the Church. Bit diheu y ba6p pan yw ym mynnwent manachla6c Glastynbri, g6edy g6eli angheua6l ar auon Gamlan, y clad6yt Arthur, y r6ng d6y groes o vaen g6neuthuredic o gywreinr6yd saeroniaeth.

Let it be certain to all that it is in the graveyard of the monastery of Glastonbury, after his mortal wound on the river Camlan, that Arthur was buried, between two crosses of stone made from the ingenuity of craftsmanship. And these were raised standing highly, with letters on them which had been to proclaim that the grave of Arthur was there. And now those letters have been worn away from age. Bit honneit, hagen, y ba6p nat maen marmor oed ved Arthur. Na bed ar Arthur nyd oed, namyn y ossot y my6n derwen g6edy ry geua6, a’e gladu vn droetued ar bymthec o dyfynder yn y daear.

Let it be known, however, to all, that the grave of Arthur was not of marble stone. There was no grave for Arthur, except that he was placed inside an oak after it had been hollowed out, and he was buried sixteen feet deep in the earth. The grave is two parts of length, as if the two highest thirds were separated from the [lower] third. And as if it were a border between them, the third part is separated from them by the arranged bones of Arthur, which were large and sturdy. In the skull there were sixteen wounds, and each one of them had closed and hardened except one, and that one was open and large, as though it were certain that it was from that one that he had become dead [i.e. that had been fatal to him.] Yn y dryded rann o’r bed, megys o’r deu parth y waeret, yd oed esgyrn G6enh6yuar y wreic, ual y gellit eu hadnabot yn vanolach ac yn wreigeid.

And among those things a plait of yellow hair was found. It was fair to look upon. And on the plait a monk from the monastery fixed his gaze, he who had come together with the group to the opening of the grave. And he noticed [it] before the rest. He hastened and snatched the plait. And as he took it in his hand and showed it, with all looking and marveling at its beauty, suddenly in front of everyone it disappeared from his hand. And that event did not happen without miracles. And it was shown manifestly to everyone, and chiefly to the religious men who came there, the thing which was least appropriate for them, that they should not look nor feel a woman’s hair: that every worldly thing, most especially all the things most beautiful to look upon, is transitory and common, as is witnessed through the judgement and authority of the wise man, who said this: “Fairness and stature of human appearance is transitory and swift, quicker to flee and to vanish than the inconstancy of spring flowers.” Dyeithyr hynn, y brenhin Arthur a vu bennaf seila6dyr manachla6c Glastynbri, kanys kynn dyuot Saesson y’r ynys, y rodassei ef tir a daear a da arall y’r vanachla6c honno, a daroed y c..."

This is one of six compositions in the genre by fifteenth-century author Carvajal (or Carvajales). Very little is known about Carvajal’s life. His poetry is linked to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples (r. 1442-1458) and to that of Alfonso’s son Ferrante (r. 1459-1494). In addition to his famous serranillas , Carvajal is also known for his literary epistles and ballads.  In this poem, Carvajal subverts some of the genre’s conventions, as he does not meet a serrana but a lady of the court—the Princess of Rossano—in the context in which he would have normally run into a rustic woman. Upon encountering the lady, the poet ponders her beauty with references to biblical and mythological characters. \n Further Reading \n Carvajal. Poesie , edited by Emma Scoles.

    "body": " De igne et aqua, dial. 9. Concerning Fire and Water, the ninth dialogue ﻿Ignis est lenis, purus, subtilis, mobilis, lucidus et calidus, et quia est tam pretiosus, in se sublimari cœpit dicens: ego in terra omnibns prævaleo et cuncta consumo, sed si in aquis prævalerem , superlatus omnibus existerem. Fire is light, pure, fine, mobile, bright, and hot. He began to exalt himself because he was so valuable. “I prevail over all on earth; I eat up all on earth. If I were to prevail against Water, I would be revered beyond all things.” Pro tanto ad se clamavit aquam dicens: soror carissima, elementum Dei es tu velut ego, quapropter, si tibi commoratus fuero et tecum connexus, non solum magnus sed magnificentior et excellentior apparebo. For this reason, he called Water to himself and said, “Dearest sister, you are an element of God like me. If I were to stay with you and be joined to you I would seem not only great but even more magnificent and excellent. Unde obsecro te, permitte me tecum morari et in te gloriari. I beg you, let me stay with you and revel in you.” Aqua vero simulare se ingeniose cœpit dicens: desiderio desideravi hoc pascha tecum manducare, accede ad me secure et te pro viribus meliorabo. Water began to pretend shrewdly and said, “I too wanted to feast with you this Easter. Do not worry; come over to me and I will improve you to the best of my ability.” Ignis quoque hoc audiens jucundari cœpit et amicabiliter ad aquam intravit, aqua vero, dum ignem in se haberet, assistentibus sibi dixit: iste inimicus et contrarius est generis mei; hic me sæpe consumpsit et ad nihilum redegit, modo me vindicare possum et ipsum exstinguere, si volo, sed juxta verbum apostoli nolo reddere malum pro malo, ne seculum privetur tanto bono, tamen volo ipsum aliquantulum humiliare. Hearing these words, Fire began to rejoice and entered Water in a friendly manner. Once Water held Fire in herself, she said to those around her, “This is my enemy and the opposite of my nature. He has often devoured me and turned me back to nothing. I could claim revenge and extinguish him if I wanted to. However, in accordance with the command of the Apostle, I refuse to exchange wrong for wrong, lest the world be robbed of such a great good. Nevertheless I wish to humiliate him a little.” Et hæc dicens parum collegit se et in ignem mingere cœpit. Et ob hoc orare aquam ignis cœpit, ue ipsum exstiugueret. Speaking thus, she collected herself somewhat and began to urinate onto Fire, who started to beg Water not to extinguish him. Aqua vero miserta est ei nec eum ex toto exstinxit, sed ad terram ipsum deduxit dicens: Deo daraus dulcera sonum reddendo pro malo bonum. Indeed, Water took pity on him and did not extinguish him entirely, but led him back to dry land, Sed multi hodie per contrarium reddunt pro malo malum, cum volunt vindictam assumere nolentes offensas dimittere. On the contrary, however, many people today fight wrongs with wrongs. Indeed, they want to take vengeance and refuse to forget any offense. Propter quod Hieronimus dicit: quoniam Deus donavit in Christo peccata nostra, sie et uos dimittamus his, qui in nobis peccant, et Dei imitatio injuriam nobis faetam frangit et revocat. On this matter, Hieronimus says, “Just as God forgave our sins in Christ, so we must forgive those that sin against us; our imitation of God breaks and revokes any injury that we have suffered.” Sicut legitur in historiis Alexandri, quod, cum quidam eum graviter offendisset, nolebat ei dimittere, Aristoteles autem hoc cognoscens perrexit ad eum et ait: volo, domine, quod hodie sis victoriosus ultra quod fuisti. It is written in the histories of Alexander that when someone once offended him badly, he was not willing to forgive them. However, Aristotle took notice and went over to Alexander. “I want, lord, for you to be even more victorious today than you have ever been before.” Quo respondente ait: bene volo. “I desire this too,” said Alexander. Cui ille: tu, rex, superasti omnia regna mundi, sed hodie tu superatus es, quia, si te permittis superari, victus es; si tu quoque vincis temetipsum, victoriosus eris, quia, qui semetipsum vincit, contra omnia fortis est, ut dicit philosophus. In response, Aristotle said, “King, you have overcome all the kingdoms of the world, but today you have been overcome. After all, if you allow yourself to be overcome [by vindictiveness], then you are conquered. However, if you conquer yourself, you shall be all the more victorious, since whoever conquers himself is mighty against all. So sayeth the philosopher.” Ad hæc verba vindictam remisit Alexander et placatus est. Hearing these words, Alexander forgave the offense and regained his calm. Propter quod dicitur Prov. XVI: melius est patiens viro forti et qui dominatur animo suo expugnatore urbium. In the same vein, consider Proverbs XVI: “A patient man is better than a strong man, and he who is lord of his soul is better than a conqueror of cities.” \n Introduction to t..."

Concerning the Leopard and the Unicorn Who Fought the Dragon, the eighty-eighth dialogue ﻿Leopardus, ut Solmus dicit, animal est generatum ex leone et pardo. The leopard, as Solinus says, was born from the lion and the panther. Horum feminæ sunt audaciores et fortiores maribus. The females of this species are braver and stronger than the males. Plinius: aliquis volens resistere leopardis furentibus, fricet allia inter manus, nee mora, leopardus resiliet nec resistet, quia odorem allii sustinere non potest. Pliny writes that someone who wants to combat raging leopards should immediately rub garlic cloves between his hands. The leopard will retreat and fight no longer, since it cannot bear the odor of garlic. Leopardus subrufum colorem habet, maculas per totum nigras; multo minores sunt quam leones. Moreover, leopards are orange in color but covered in black spots, and are are much smaller than lions. Leopardus, quando comedit aliquod venenum, stercus hominis quærit, quod comedit, et sanatur. Ambrosius. Ambrose claims that if a leopard has eaten poison, it will seek out a man’s excrement, which, once consumed, heals it. Hæ bestiæ sunt crudelissimæ naturaliter, ita quod sic domesticari non possunt, ut obliviscantur crudelitatis suæ. These beasts are most cruel by nature, and cannot be tamed to forget their cruelty. Domesticantur tamen ad venandum. Nevertheless they can be trained to hunt. Igitur dum ad prædam in venatione ducuntur, relaxantur, quam si quarto aut quinto saltu non potest capere, subsistit iratus fortiter, et nisi statim venator furenti bestiæ aliquam bestiam offerat, cujus sanguine placetur, irruit in venatorem vel quoscunque obvios, quia impossibile est placari eum nisi in sanguine. When leopards are led to their prey in the course of a hunt, they become calm. However, if a leopard is unable to seize his prey in four or five leaps, he stops, profoundly angered. In such cases, unless a hunter offers some animal to the furious beast, so as to placate it with blood, it will charge at the hunter or whoever else happens to be in its way. It is impossible to calm a leopard down except by bloodshed. Hic pugnabat cum dracone, sed non prævalebat, propter quod ad unicornem perrexit et humiliter ipsum obsecravit dicens: eminens es ac virtuosus et doctus belli, peto obnixe, quod me defendas a furore draconis. Once, a Leopard fought with a Dragon, but he did not prevail. Therefore, he headed to the Unicorn and humbly entreated him, saying, “You are lofty, and virtuous, and learned in war. I beseech you with all my heart to defend me from the Dragon’s madness.” Unicornis autem se sublimare cœpit et audiens de se talia dici ait: verum dicis, quia doctus sum prælii, propterea optime defensabo te, noli pavere, cum enim aperiet draco os suum, in gutture ipsum cornu perforabo. The Unicorn began to rise upon hearing such words spoken about himself. He said, “You speak truly, since I am battlewise, and I shall protect you in the best way possible. Do not fear, for when the Dragon opens his mouth I will pierce his throat with my horn.” Cum autem ad draconem pariter venissent, leopardus bellum initiavit sperans de auxilio unicornis. After they had found the Dragon together, the Leopard began the fight, pinning his hopes on the Unicorn’s help. Draco vero certavit adversus eos et ignem et fœtorem ex ore emittebat, sed cum os aperiret, unicornis quam citius cucurrit volens ipsum in gutture transvibrare, draco vero agitavit caput et unicornis cornu in terram fixit dicens moriendo: qui pro alio vult pugnare, cupit se trucidare. The Dragon fought against them, spitting out fire and fumes. When he opened his mouth, the Unicorn charged at him as swiftly as he could, aiming to pierce through his throat. However, the Dragon shook his head, and drove the Unicorn’s horn into the earth. As the Unicorn died, the Dragon said to him, “He who wants to fight for another desires to slay himself. Sic enim stultum est, de se confidere ac de quo sibi non pertinet agonizare. It is foolish to be so self-assured and to fight over that which does not concern you.” Unde Eccl. XI0: de ea re, quæ te non molestat, ne certaveris. Indeed, as Ecclesiastes XI says, “Do not fight on account of that which does not vex you.” Ergo require in animo tuo a te ipso, quis es, quid facere vis, utrum factum illud ad te pertineat. Make yourself certain as to who you are, what you desire to do, and whether the matter concerns you. Ad minus ad alium te immiscere non debes. At the very least, you should not implicate yourself with another. Noli pro alio pugnare nec inter discordantes discordiam augere, sed fac, ut dicit Seneca: semper dissensio ab alio ineipiat, a te reconciliatio. Quidam bellantes aggressi sunt inimicum, sed alius quidam cucurrit volens ipsum defendere et armavit se versus inimicos illius. Once, some warriors attacked their enemy, but some other man hastened to the fight, wanting on..."

Concerning Life and Death, the hundred and twenty-second dialogue Mors secundum philosophum et æternus somnus, divitum pavor, pauperum desiderium, incurabilis eventus, latro hominis, fuga vitæ, resolutio hominis. Death, according to the Philosopher, is eternal sleep, the fear of the wealthy, the desire of th epoor, an irremediable outcome, the bandit of mankind, the rout of life, and Man’s release. Vita vero est bonorum lætitia, miserorum mœstitia. Life, on the contrary, is the delight of the good and the grief of the evil. Et homo quidam juvenis formosus, dives, fortis et sanus ad mortem progreditur et ait: o sors immutabilis, miserere mei et exaudi me, supplicium, quod a te exspecto, noli emittere ad me, aurum et argentum, lapides pretiosos, mancipia, equos, fundos, prædia, palatia, possessiones et quidquid vis, tibi dabo, tamtumnodo noli me tangere. Some young man, handsome, wealthy, strong, and healthy, approaches death and says: ‘O unchangeable Destiny, have pity upon me and hear my entreaty: that you not visit upon me the punishment which I expect from you. I shall give you gold and silver, precious stones, slaves, Cui mors : impossibilia petis , o frater , non sunt petenda a Deo nisi honesta et possibilia ideoque non sapienter locutus es, quia dicitur homini, mors ubique te exspectat et tu, si sapiens fueris, ubique eam exspectabis. Death says to him: ‘O brother, you ask for that which is impossible, and you should not ask anything from God unless that which is honorable and possible. Hence, you have not spoken wisely, and indeed it is said to Man, “Death awaits you everywhere and if you are wise, you shall expect Her everywhere too.” Dicitur enim Psalm. LXXXVIII: quis est homo, qui vivit et non videbit mortem? After all, Psalm 88 says ‘What man can live and not see death?’ quasi dicat, nullus. as if to mean that there is no such man. Unde versus: per nullam sortem poteris evadere mortem. Hence the verse: ‘You shall not be able to avoid death through any act of Fate.’ Mors resecat, mors omne necat, quod carne creatur. Death cuts off and kills everything which is created in flesh; Ergo patienter recipe me , quia tibi nihil novi veni facere. accept me with equanimity, since I have not come to do anything out of the ordinary to you. Ait enim Seneca: nemo tam imperitus est, ut nesciat se aliquando moriturum. After all, Seneca writes: ‘No one is so ignorant that he does Tamen, mors cum propere accesserit, tremis, ploras. nevertheless, when death draws near, you tremble and cry. Quid fles, quid ploras, quia morieris, ad hanc legem natus? Quid tibi novi est? What do you find odd in this? Ad hanc legem natus es, hoc patri tuo accidit, hoc et matri et majoribus tuis, hoc omnibus ante te, hoc omnibus post te, vita enim cum exceptione mortis data non est. You were born under this law; this fate befell your father, as well as your mother and your ancestors, along with all who came before and will come after you, for life is never granted together with immunity to death. Lex universalis est, quæ jubet nasci et mori, hoc autem intelligas vitam gerendo. It is a universal law which dictates that we be born and then die, and you should understand this in the course of living your life.’ Ait idem: debemus nos portare, quod non possumus vitare. He also writes: ‘We must bear that which we cannot avoid.’ Exemplum de David de filio mortuo: quia mortuus est, quare jejuno? David, upon the death of his son, exemplified this maxim: ‘Since he is dead, why do I fast? Numquid potero revocare eum? Surely I shan’t be able to summon him back? Ego vadam magis ad eum, ipse non revertetur ad me. On the contrary, I shall go to him, but he will not come back to me.’ Unde nuntiata cuidam philosopho morte filii ait: quoniam eum genui, inquit, moriturum scivi. Hence some philosopher also responded thus, after the death of his son had been reported to him: ‘Given that I fathered him’, he said, ‘I knew that he must die.’ Narrat Valerius 1. V. c. X dicens, quod Anaxagoras audita morte filii respondit : nihil quidem inexspectatum aut novum nuntias, Valerius [Maximus] also tells this story at Book 5 Chapter 10 [of his Memorable Doings and Sayings], by noting that Anaxagoras, upon hearing of the death of his son, responded: ‘You announce to me nothing unexpected or new. ego eum natum ex me sciebam esse mortalem, I knew that he was born from me and mortal. atque a lege naturae accipiendi spiritus et reddendi legem didici, neminem mori, qui non vixerit, ita nec quidem vivere aliquem, qui non sit moriturus naturaliter. I also learned that the terms upon which we receive breath and give it back are derived from the law of Nature, so that no one dies who has not lived, and likewise no one lives who will not die in accordance with his nature.’ Ibidem, quod Xenophon audita morte filii sui majoris natu, qui in bello occiderat, coronam tamen deponere contentus fuit.

Concerning Man and Woman, the one hundred and twenty-first dialogue ﻿Homo est secundum philosophum mens incarnata, fantasma corporis, speculator vitæ, mancipium mortis, transiens viator, loci hospes, anima laboriosa, parvi temporis habitaculum. According to the philosopher, Man is the mind made flesh, a phantom of time, Mulier est secundum philosophum hominis confusio, insatiabilis bestia, continua sollicitudo, indeficiens pugna, humanum mancipium et viro continenti naufragium. Woman is the confusion of mankind, an insatiable beast, a perpetual worry, an unceasing battle, a human slave, Prout quidam vir castus et immaculatus quandoque habere voluit colloquium mulieris et familiaritatem, in qua illectus et illaqueatus sigillum castitatis quam cito amisit, attendens autem ad dulcedinem verbi illius et intuens pulchritudinem faciei ejus dissipatus est dicens: propter mulieres fracti multi sunt et vulnerati. Once, a pure and immaculate Man wanted to have a conversation and an intimate relationship with a Woman. Seduced and ensnared, he lost his mark of chastity as quickly as possible. As he paid attention to the sweetness of her words and the beauty of her face, he fell headlong into destruction, saying, “Many men have been broken and wounded because of women.&quot; Unde ait quidam: peccati forma femina est et mortis conditio. Thus it is said, “Sin and death take a feminine form.” Hieronimus: janua diaboli, via iniquitatis, scorpionis percussio nocivumque genus est femina. Similarly, Jerome wrote, “Woman is the devil’s doorway, the path of wickedness, the sting of the scorpion, and the harmful sex.” Idem: gladius igneus est species mulieris; memento, quod Thamar a fratre suo sit corrupta, memento semper, quod paradisi colonum de possessione sua ejecit mulier. He also wrote, “A woman’s appearance is a fiery sword. Remember that Tamar was corrupted by her own brother; remember always that woman expelled the inhabitant of Paradise from his own lands.” Quid fortius Samsone? quid sapientius Salomone? quid sanctius David? Who is stronger than Samson? Who is wiser than Solomon? Who is more holy than David? Omnes hi per feminas subversi sunt. All these men were subverted by women. Eccl. XXV: a muliere initium factum est peccati et per illam homines moriuntur. Ecclesiastes XXV: “The beginning of sin was made by a woman, and it is because of her that men die.” Unde antiqui ab ipsis se continuerunt, prout narrat Vegetius L. II0 de continentia Alexandri, quod, cum esset ei virgo eximiae pulchritudinis tradita, cuidam principi desponsata, summa abstinentia pepercit ei, ut nec eam adspiceret, sed ad spousüm remisit, qua remissa mulieris ac principis mentes sibi reconciliavit. For this reason, the ancients always abstained from women. For example, Vegetius tells us in his second book about the self-restraint of Alexander. When a maiden of remarkable beauty betrothed to another prince was brought before him, he restrained himself with the highest abstinence so that he did not even look at her, but returned her to her groom and reconciled them to one another. Cui simile narrat Valerius lib. IV. cap. III de Scipione dicens, quod, cum intellexisset, quod virgo eximiæ formæ cuidam nobili desponsata esset inter obsides, qui erant apud Carthaginem, postquam Carthago fuit ab ipso capta, vocatis parentibus virginis et sponso, immaculatam virginem iis tradidit et aurum, quod pro redemtione puellæ oblatum erat, virgini in dotem sive marito in munus nuptiale dedit, per quam coutinentiam et munificientiam animos illorum sibi applicuit. Valerius tells us something similar concerning Scipio in book IV chapter III. After he took Carthage, he discovered that an extremely beautiful maiden engaged to a nobleman was among the hostages of that city. Having summoned her parents, he delivered their daughter to them along with a sum of gold as her dowry or as a marriage-gift for her husband. This sum had originally been given to him for the redemption of the girl. By this act of self-restraint and generosity, he won the hearts of the Carthaginians. De mira etiam continentia Xenocratis philosophi narrat Valerius eodem cap. In the same chapter, Valerius describes the miraculous self-control of the philosopher Xenocrates. dicens, quod apud Athenas quidam juvenes promiserunt cuidam mulieri impudicæ pecuniam sibi dare, si animum philosophi posset ad luxuriam inflectere. Some young men of Athens promised money to a shameless woman if she could influence him towards decadence. Quae nocte veniens juxta eum aceubuit nec in aliquo ejus continentiam labefecit et deridentibus adolescentibus, quod animum illius flectere non potuisset, respondit, quod non ad hominem sed ad statuam perrexisset. That night, she came and laid down on the bed beside him. However, she could not undo his rectitude. To the youths, who mocked her for being unable to influence Xenocrates, she retorted that she had not gone to a man but to a statue. Voc..."

    "body": " De topasio pretioso, dial. 16. Concerning Precious Topaz, the sixteenth dialogue ﻿Topasius, ut dicit Papias, est gemma, quæ omnium lapidum in se habet colores. Topaz, as Papias writes, is a jewel that holds the colors of all other stones in itself. Ysidor. Ethim. libro XVI. dicit, quod est gemma quædam ex virenti genere omnique colore splendens, inventa primum in Arabiæ insula, quæ dicitur Topazi, unde topazius dictus est ab insula. Similarly, Isidor writes in book sixteen of the Etymologies that it is a primarily green-coloured jewel that also shines in every color, and was first discovered on an Arabian island called Topazi, whence topaz takes its name. Quidam autem topacius de Arabia ductus est Romam et in ecclesia beati Petri super crucem collocatus est et consecratus est, in quo loco ab omnibus avide videbatur. Once, a topaz was taken from Arabia to Rome, and placed above the cross in blessed Peter’s Church. It was consecrated there and admired enthusiastically by everyone. Hic a persuasione in ima ductus ait: quid est semper in ecclesia manere et nunquam recedere nec aliquid de mundo sentire? Convinced to exchange its lofty place for lower realms, the Topaz said, “Why must I always remain in the church and never leave, nor see anything of the world? volo enim cito ad seculum redire, ut aliquantulum cum secularibus recreari possim in seculo et regnare cum Christo. I desire to go back to the world for a short while, so that I might have a little recreation with those of the world and then reign with Christ.” Cumque ad seculum reversus fuisset ac de sacrosaneta ecclesia recederet, ab illicitis concupiscentiis mundi captus exposuit se omnibus flagitiis. However, after he had returned to the world and departed from the holy church, he was captivated by forbidden desires and exposed himself to sinful acts. Ad extremum autem a barbaris repertus et ab ipsis incognitus collisus est et dispersus, ita quod nunquam comparuit. Finally, the Topaz was discovered by barbarians, who did not recognise him. As a result, he was smashed and scattered so that he never appeared whole again. Tandem confractus ait: qui de loco sacro pergit, justum est, si se dispergit. Finally broken, the Topaz said: “He who leaves a holy place is justly destroyed.” Ergo caveant religiosi ad seculum redire, ne similiter pereant. Therefore, may the religious beware of going back to the world, lest they perish in the same way. Concupiscentiæ enim sunt naufragia religiosorum. After all, desire is a shipwreck for the pious. Et ideo dicit Augustinus: sicut dilectio Dei est omnium virtutum fons, ita dilectio mundi est fons omnium vitiorum. Similarly, Augustine writes, “Just as love of God is the font of all virtue, love of the world is the font of all sin. Unde qui vult Deum possidere, mundo renuntiet, ut sit illi Deus beata possessio. Hence, whoever wishes to attain God ought to renounce the world so that he might achieve the blessed attainment of God.” Dicit Bernardus: perfectus servus Christi nihil habet nisi Christum et si aliquid præter Christum habet, perfectus non est. Thus also Bernard: “The perfect servant of Christ possesses nothing except for Christ; if he possesses anything else, he is not perfect.” Unde idem: qui spiritualibus bonis sunt dotati, terrenis negotiis non debent implicari. Additionally, Bernard writes, “Whosoever is endowed with spiritual goods need not be implicated in worldly matters.” Legitur in Vitas patrum [sic], quod quidam frater interrogavit senem dicens: quid faciam, quia cogitatio mea me non dimittit, me nec una hora sedere in cella mea? It is said in The Lives of the Fathers Et dicit ei senex: fili, revertere et sede in cella tua et labora manibus tuis et ora Deum incessanter et jacta cogitatum tuum in domino et cave, ne te quis seducat, ut exeas, et dicebat. The old man responded, “Son, go away and sit in your cell. Work with your hands, and pray unceasingly to God, and cast your thoughts towards the Lord. Moreover, beware lest anyone should tempt you to exit your cell.” Quidam secularis erat adolescens habens patrem et desiderabat fieri monachus. There was, once, a young man of the world whose father was still alive. He wanted to become a monk. Et dum multum supplicaret patri suo, ut dimitteret eum converti, non acquiescebat pater. However, although he begged his father many times to allow him to take his vows, his father refused. Postmodum autem rogatus a fidelibus amicis, vix acquievit. Eventually, his father begrudgingly agreed, but only after been petitioned by his intimate friends. Et egressus frater ille adolescens introivit monasterium et factus monachus cœpit omne opus monasterii perfecte perficere et jejunare quotidie. The young man left his home and entered a monastery.

The preface to the book, The Moral Dialogue of Creatures, which pertains to every moral subject and is written in a pleasant and didactic style, begins thus: Quoniam sicut testatur Ysidorus in libro de summo bono, libro primo capite quarto dicens, quod ex pulchritudine circumscriptæ naturæ ostendit nobis deus pulchritudinis suæ partem aliquam. Just as Isidor the Witness says in his book De Summo Bono (On the Highest Good) in part one chapter four, God shows us some part of His own beauty through the beauty of enclosed nature. Qui circumscribi nequit et intelligi, ut ipsis eisdem vestigiis homo revertatur ad deum, quibus aversus est a Deo, et qui per amorem pulchritudinis creaturæ a creatoris forma se abstulit, rursus per creaturæ decorem ad creatoris sui pulcritudinem revertatur. Indeed, God - who cannot be comprehended or enclosed - does so, in order that man might return to God by retracing those very tracks which he has followed when turning away from God; and in order that the man, who through love of a creature’s beauty has snatched himself away from his Creator’s form, might again turn back to his Creator’s beauty through the elegance of the creature. Quæ quidem creaturæ ctsi nobis, sicut liber iste fingit, dyalecticæ voce formata non loquantur, inclinatione tamen et naturalis institutionis proprietate nos docere nostrosque mores corrigere, si bene pensamus, non desinunt. Admittedly, creatures do not speak to us in reasoned phrases, as this book pretends; however, if we ponder them well, they neither cease to teach us about the tendencies and qualities of the institution of nature nor to correct our customs. Indeed, if we consider their words well, they will not cease to help us. Quod illud gloriosum lumen doctorum sanctus Augustinus optime intelligebat, cum dicebat: o domine deus, omnes creaturæ tuæ, quas fecisti, ad me clamant et clamare non desinunt, ut te solum deum creatorem meum super omnia diligam. The glorious light of the learned, Saint Augustine, understood this when he said, “O Lord God, all Your creatures, which You have made, cry out to me and do not cease to cry out: they do this, so that I may love You alone, God my Creator, above all things.” Et ideo auctor libri istius hæc rite considerans quosdam dyalogos creaturarum ad sanam et moralem doctrinam applicavit, confinxit et composuit, ut per creaturarum quasi nobis loquentium proprietates simnl in moribus erudiamur et tædium audientium evitemus et ipsorum audientium memoriam adjuvemus, quod maxime per rerum similitudines procuratur. Rightly considering this, therefore, the author of the Dialogue devised, composed, and applied creatures’ dialogues to healthy and moral doctrine so that we might be edified through the characters of creatures who speak just as we do; moreover, that we might simultaneously avoid inflicting boredom on our listeners and aid their memory. All this is best attained through parables. Salvator enim noster omnium prædicatorum perfecta forma fabulis, palæstinorum more usus est, ut rerum similitudine ad viam veritatis homines perduceret. Our Savior perfected the form of the preacher’s fable – according to the tradition of the Palestinians – and used it to lead men by way of imitation towards the way of truth. Auctor ergo libri præsentis jocundo modo morales doctrinas in exterminium vitiorum et virtutum promotionem introducit. Likewise, the author of the present book introduces moral doctrines in a pleasant manner to exterminate vices and promote virtues. Quod utique licet et expedieus est, ut dicit doctor sanctus secunda secundæ qu. CLXVIII in solutione ultimi argumenti et hoc, si fictio exterior interiori devotioni et dispositioni bonæ conveniat. As the learned Saint [Aquinas] says in the second part of the second part [of the Summa Theologiae], in the solution to the final argument of question 168: “Undoubtedly, that which is expedient is permitted, as long as one’s external pretence matches his internal devotion and good character.” Utilis est ergo præsens liber prædicatoribus et aliis quibusque intelligentibus contra fatigationem animalem, ut per delectationem jocundæ materiæ aliqualiter intermissa intentione ad insistendum rationis studio simplicium animi ad altiora trahantur. Hence, the present book is useful for preachers and all others who understand that by enjoying pleasant matters, which somehow provide a break from difficult work and minimise human fatigue, simple minds might be naturally drawn to higher matters. Sicut in Collationibus patrum legitur,quod beatus evangelista Johannes, dum quidam scandalizaretur, quod eum cum suis discipulis ludentem invenit, dicitur illi mandasse, qui arcum gerebat, ut sagittam traheret.

Concerning Saturn and the Cloud, the second dialogue ﻿Septum sunt planetæ secundum dicta philosophorum, scilicet Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercurius et Luna, sed distantia magna est inter planetam et planetam. According to the philosopher, there are seven planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. However, there is a great distance from one planet to another. Quia refert magister Moyses maximus philosophus, ut habetur in Aurea Legenda, quod quilibet circulus cujuslibet planetæ habet in spissitudine viam quingentorum annorum id est tantum spatium, quantum posset aliquis ire in quingentis annis de via plana ita tamen, quod iter cujuslibet diei sit quadraginta milliaria et quodlibet milliare sit duorum millium passuum. Hence the teacher Moyses, the greatest philosopher, says in the Golden Legend that every planet’s orbit is the size of a five-hundred-year path. That is to say, there is as much space in a planet’s orbit as someone could walk in five hundred years on a level road, if he journeyed forty miles a day and every mile consisted of two thousand paces. Quadam autem vice quædam nubes magna et spissa se elevare coepit dicens: magna est excellentia mea, quia propter meam magnitudinem planetæ in mundo apparere non valent, dum in aëre me pono; sed cum sim sub ipsis et eas sic obnubilo quanto magis, si adscendero superius, offuscare et suppeditare potero, multo magis certe. Once upon a time, a great and thick Cloud began to revere herself, saying, “Truly, my excellence is great; on account of my size, the planets cannot appear in the world, so long as I interpose myself in the air. Even now, when I am beneath them, I manage to block them out. If I were to ascend higher, therefore, how much more greatly would I be able to cover them and subordinate them? Certainly I would be able to do so far more greatly.&quot; Et hoc dicens sursum tendere cœpit cumque usque ad Saturnum ascenderet et superscandere vellet, ait Saturnus: quis es tu, qui ascendere cupis, ubi nunquam ullus ascendit? Speaking thus, she began to stretch upwards. When she had risen all the way to Saturn, she tried to clamber over him. Saturn spoke: “Who are you, who desires to rise to where no one has ever risen?” Cui nubes: ego super ascendam et te præcipitabo. In response, the Cloud said, “I will rise above you and cast you down.” Hoc audiens Saturnus perturbatus ad arma cucurrit et viam ei clausit, insuper et nubem dejecit et ad nihilum redegit dicens: convenit eum recidivare, qui vult super omnes stare. Saturn was thoroughly disturbed by these words; he ran to fetch his weapons and shut off the Cloud’s path. Then he threw down the Cloud from above and reduced her to nothing, saying, “Those who desire to stand above all deserve to fall down.” Hoc enim accidit Nabugodonosor, qui super omnes reges et principes terræ scandere satagebat, ut esset rex regum et dominus dominorum terrenorum, nesciens præ superbia, quod dominetur excelsus super regnum hominum. So it was for Nebuchadnezzar, who strove to overthrow all the earth’s kings and princes, so that he might be the king of earthly kings and the lord of earthly lords, not knowing because of his haughtiness that the Exalted [God] is the king of all men. De quo dicitur Danielis IVto: quando elatum est cor Nabugodonosor et spiritus ejus confirmatus est ad superbiam, depositus est de solio suo. The fourth book of Daniel reads, “When Nebuchadnezzar’s heart was raised up and his spirit was fortified into arrogance, he was deposed from his own throne.” Unde dictum est ei: ejiciet te deus ab hominibus et tum bestiis atque feris erit habitatio tua, fœnum ut bos comedes septemque tempora mutabuntur in te. Wherefore it was said to him, “God will cast you away from men; then, you will live among beasts and wild animals. You shall eat hay like an ox. Seven seasons will pass by for you.” Sicut dicitur in Hystoriis Scholasticis: non est factus secundum mutationem corporis sed secundum mentis alienationem et ablatus est ei sensus et usus linguæ et videbatur sibi, quod esset bos sive taurus in anterioribus, in posterioribus autem leo. As it is said in the Scholastic Histories, “His body did not change, but his mind was alienated; his senses and his speech were stricken from him. It then seemed to him that he was an ox or a bull in the front, but a lion in the back.” Daniel quoque toto tempore alienationis ejus pro eo orabat, ita quod septem tempora, id est septem anni ad preces suas in septem menses mutati sunt. Throughout the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s alienation, Daniel prayed for him; as a result, the seven seasons – seven years, that is – were changed, through his prayers, into seven months. In quibus septem mensibus insaniam patiebatur per quadraginta dies, per alios vero quadraginta ad cor reversus flebat et orabat deum, ita quod ex magnis fletibus oculi ejus ut caro facti sunt. During these seven months Nebuchadnezzar suffered madness for f..."

Luna vero, ut dicit Ambrosius in Exameron, est decor noctis, mater totius humoris et ministra, mensura temporum, dominatrix maris, immutatrix aëris et æmulatrix solis, et propter quod est æmulatrix solis, soli incepit detrahere et eum diffamare. The moon, however, as Ambrosius says in his Exameron, is the night’s finery, the mother and servant of all liquids, the measure of time, the queen of the sea, the transformer of the air, and the imitator of the Sun. Sol autem hoc sentiens loquutus est lunæ dicens: quare mihi detrahis et blasphemas? The Sun, sensing this, spoke to the Moon, saying, “Why do you pull me down, and blaspheme me? Ego semper te illuminavi et præcessi, tu autem semper me odis et impugnas. I have always illuminated you, and gone ahead of you; yet now you hate me and attack me.” Cui luna: recede a me, quia te non diligo, cum propter tuum magnum splendorem ego nihil appretior in mundo; si non esses, seculo superlata essem ego. To whom the Moon answered, “Depart from me for I do not love you. After all, thanks to your great splendor, the world does not value me at all. If you did not exist, I would be extolled as the greatest being in the world.” Cui sol: ingrata sufficiat tibi magnificentia tua; si ego in die, tu vero in nocte perlustras. In turn, the Sun responded, “Thankless creature, let your magnificence satisfy you. Indeed, I shine in the day, but you shine at night. Obediamus ergo creatori nostro et noli superbire super me, sed me permitte lucere in die ac bona domini munire. Let us therefore obey our creator. Stop behaving arrogantly towards me, but allow me to shine during the day and guard over the good works of the Lord.” Luna vero magis animata recessit cum furore et stellas ad se clamavit aggregavitque magnum exercitum et cum sole prœliari cœit. At this, however, the Moon drew back, even more incensed with fury. She called the stars to herself, assembling a great army, and began to battle with the Sun. Sagittas enim mittebat adversus solem et cum jaculis percutere nitebatur. She sent arrows against the Sun and strove to pierce him with darts. Sol autem cum esset superius, descendit et lunam cum mucrone partitus est et stellas dejecit dicens: sie semper, cum eris rotunda, faciam tibi. Nevertheless, since the Sun inhabited a higher sphere, he simply descended and split the Moon with the point of his sword. Then, casting down the stars, he said, “Thus shall I always cleave you when you are full.” Hac enim de causa, ut fabulæ dicunt, luna nunquam rotunda permanet et stellæ casum habent. As the stories say, it is because of this that the Moon never stays full and the stars fall. Luna ergo coufusa in verecundia mansit dicens: turgidam melius partiri erat quam totam perire. The thwarted Moon wallowed in shame, saying: “It is better to be divided when overfull than to perish entirely.” Sic enim multi superbi et elati volunt sibi dominari nec superiorem vel similem cupiunt habere. In this way many of the proud and the powerful want to rule alone, and they desire to have neither superiors nor equals. Unde glosa: superbia est elatio incensa quæ inferioribus despiciens superioribus et paribus satagit dominari. Hence the following gloss: “Pride is incensed dignity which, despising inferiors, tries to rule over both superiors and equals. Nam velle quidem esse super omnes vituperabiliter malum est, sustinere alterum sibi similem gloriosum est, ut ait Chrysostomus. Indeed, to desire to outrank all others is horribly wicked, but it is glorious to hold another up as equal to oneself.” So says Chrysostomos. De talibus enim dicit poeta: tolluntur in altum ut lapsu graviori cadant. Concerning such matters, the poet says, “The exalted are raised up so that they can experience a more grievous fall. Et nota, quod, quanto est major assensus, tanto est major et periculosior casus. Moreover, it is known that the greater one’s popularity is, the more perilous his fall will be. Qui enim de plano et infimo loco cadit, cito resurgit, qui autem de alto, cito surgere nequit. For he who falls from a flat and low place rises again swiftly, but he who falls from a height cannot rise again swiftly.” Rami enim arboris, ut dicit Chrysostomus, qui staut in summitate, cito a magno vento franguntur, qui autem sunt ad radicem, conservantur. As Chrysostomus says, “The tree’s branches growing aloft are quickly broken by a great wind, but those at the root are saved.” Unde etiam ait Quintus Curtius, quendam dixisse Alexandro ..."

And all of them came and the king told them to look in their knowledge and science to see if it was to have children or why this was forbidden / inhibited to him. And the sages searched through their knowledge of medicine and told him: “Sire, you must know that your body is cold and your semen comes forth from you very cold, and so you do not conceive. You must provide yourself with very hot spices until you ejaculate hot sperm.” And the king did as such. Afterward, the astrologers told him: “Sire, there is no doubt that you will have a child, but we do not know if it will be male or female because we see the star of Venus situated upon the sign.” So the king laid with his wife at the start of the day and she became pregnant. ابًرِيُ اُنَ كِرِيَتُرَ دَا لَشْ مَشْ فَارْمُشَشْ دَا لَشْ / مُجَارَاشْ اِ لًمَرُنْلَ كَرْكَيْسِيُنَ اِ مُرِيُ / شُمَدْرَا دَا بًرْتُ اِ دِيُلَ شُبًدْرَا اَ اُنَ نُدْرِسَ / اِ كِرِيُلَ شِيَاتَا اَنٌشْ اِ فِزُلَا شُبًدْرَا اُنَ اَلْقَصَرْ / شُبْرَا ذُرَذُ اُبْرَدُ دَا مَسُنَارِيَ اِ فِزُلَا ءَانَالْ / بَارْجَالَاشْ كُنْاَرْبُلَاشْ اِ رٍيُشْ تَرَيُلَا اَلٍي / تُذُشْ لُشْ ءَاشْتُرْمُانْتُس كَا بٌذُ اَبَارْ اِ ذَا / شُلَ اَلٍ كُنْشُشْ ذُنْزَالًشْ فَشْتَ كَا لًاغُ اَ تَانَارْ / اُنْزَا اَنٌشْ ءَانْبٌوَاشْ بِنُ اَبَارْلَ شُبًدْرَا كُنْ / لُشْ غَرَنْدَاشْ دَا شُرًايْنُ اِ تَرَيُلَا بُرَكَذُشْ / اِ شَادَشْ اِ جُيَشْ كُنْتُذُشْ لُشْ دَالَايْتَاشْ كَا بٌذُ / تَرَءَارْ اِيَانْتُرُ ذُ ءَاشْتَبَ ءَالً اِ مِرُ اَ شُفَارْمُشُرَ / اِيَنَمُرَاشَا ذَالً اِ كُمِيُ اِ بَابِيُ كُنَالً اِ كُوَ / نْذُ اُبِيَارُنْ كُمِذُ دِشُلَا لَدٌنْزَالً يَا بًدْرَا / ءَاشْتُشْ خَلَاقَذُشْ دَا اُنْبَارَاشْ اِ مُجَارَاشْ نُفُوَارُنْ / خَلَافَذُشْ شِنُ بًرَ كُمَارْ اِ بَابَارْ بٌوَاشْ كُنْ / بِيَانَا كَا اَ كِيَانْ فَزَا تَلَاشْ غَرَسِيَشْ دَا لَشْ // اَغَرَدَاسْكَمُشْ And she gave birth to a child who was among the most beautiful of women, and they called her Carcayçiyona.

And her father made her a palace covered in gold, worked of masonry, and he made within it arboretums and rivers, and he brought for her all the instruments that there could possibly be. And he left her there with her ladies-in-waiting until she turned eleven. Then, her father came to see her with the important people of his kingdom, and he brought her rich brocades and silks and jewels with all the treats that he could carry.

There are angels for sounds and for thunders,             ангелъ зимы, и зноеви, и осени, и весны, и лѣта, всему духу             angels of winter, of heat, of autumn, spring, and summer.

Ко всимъ тваремъ ангели приставлени. Tако же ангелъ приставленъ къ которой убо земли,             Angels are appointed to all creation. In the same way, an angel is appointed to each land,             да соблюдають куюжьто землю, аще суть и погани. Аще Божий гнѣвъ будеть на кую убо землю,             to guard all lands, even if they are pagan. In the case of God’s anger at a certain land,             повелѣвая ангелу тому на кую убо землю бранью ити,             God commands one of those angels to wage a war against that land,             то оной землѣ ангелъ не вопротивится повелѣнью Божью.             and the angel of the land [commanded to wage a war] does not disobey God’s command.             Яко и се бяше, и на ны навелъ Богъ, грѣхъ ради нашихъ, иноплеменникы поганыя,                         и побѣжахуть ны повелѣньемъ Божьимъ, они бо бяху водими аньеломъ по повелѣнью Божью.             and they won by God’s command, for they were led by an angel by God’s command.

И поиде со вси вои его, и ста на товарищи, и почи.             And when he was on the march with all his soldiers, he pitched a camp and went to sleep.             И приспѣ ночь, и лежа на ложи своемь посредѣ шатра, отверзъ очи свои, види мужа,             The night came, and, when he was lying in his bed inside the tent, he opened his eyes and saw a man             стояща над нимь и мѣчь нагъ в руцѣ его, и обличие меча его яко молонии.             standing above him, a naked sword in his hand, and the appearance of the sword was like lightning.             И запряже мечемь своимъ на главу цареву. И ужасеся цесарь велми и рече:             And this man made to strike the emperor’s head, and the emperor was terrified greatly and said,             «Не бий мене».

А нынѣ вѣдай,             and many people before you. Indeed, I walk before you, assisting you. However, now learn that you             яко умьреши, понеже помыслилъ еси взити въ Ерусалимъ, зло створити ерѣемъ Божьимъ и к людемъ его».             will die because you want to take Jerusalem and to harm God’s priests and His people.”             И рече царь: «Молю тя, о Господи, отпусти нынѣ грѣхъ раба твоего, аче не любо ти, а ворочюся дому моему».             And the emperor said, “I pray you, oh Lord, forgive your servant’s sin now. If this does not please you, I will return home.”             И рече ангелъ: «Не бойся, иди путемъ твоимъ къ Иерусалиму,             25. And the angel said, “Do not fear, proceed on your way to Jerusalem, and you             и узриши ту въ Ерусалими мужа въ обличении моем, и борзо пади на лици своемь,             will see there, in Jerusalem, a man with the same appearance as me.

This Latin example was written in Northern Italy, likely Venice or the Veneto region, in the 13th century. It’s preserved in Berlin in Staatsbibliothek, Preußischer Kulturbesitz, MS Ham. 390 f.26v , a manuscript that combines several oracular and mantic texts - including a mantic dream alphabet also translated in the GMS .  This text is one of eighty-eight surviving bibliomantic alphabet texts in Western manuscripts, with some surviving from as early as the twelfth century but most surviving from the fifteenth. However, these texts were likely far more popular than the surviving manuscript record attests. Their brevity made them easily duplicatable and the close similarities between the kinds of fortunes predicted by the texts indicates that they were likely copied directly from each other. \n Introduction to the Text \n This brief and anonymous text, known as a “mantic alphabet”, was part of a popular divinatory tradition around the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages known as bibliomancy - telling a fortune from books. Mantic alphabets survive in Arabic, Greek and Latin. To use such a text, a reader opened a second book - in this case the introduction prescribes a Psalter be used - at random. The reader would ponder the first letter that they saw, which would then correspond to the future as described in the alphabet. For example, if the reader opened to Psalm 1, which begins “Beatus vir qui...” they would turn back to the dreambook’s entry for letter B and learn that B predicts that they will have “power over people.”  As a personal oracle that relies on an explicitly religious text as part of its divinatory process, mantic alphabets like this one combine two seemingly incongruous traditions. Priests, theologians and other religious figures often explicitly condemned soothsayers, oracles and fortune-tellers, but some nevertheless supported such practices including Gregory of Tours (d. 594), who described the practice of bibliomancy in particular. By insisting that divination occurred only after a prayer was said and only when a Psalter was used as the source of a random letter, this mantic alphabet attests to how popular practices of personal fortune-telling were able to carefully align themselves to fit within the bounds of religious doctrine. The practice of bibliomancy was particularly popular in the late Middle Ages and similar mantic alphabets exist drawing not only from Christian sources but similarly using Byzantine, Islamic and Jewish texts to tell a reader’s fortune. \n Further Reading \n Chardonnens, László Sándor. “Mantic Alphabets in Medieval Western Manuscripts and Early Printed Books,” Modern Philology, vol. 110, no. 3, 2013, pp. 340-366.

A digitization of this manuscript may be viewed online here:  http://expositions.nlr.ru/EfrosinManuscripts/_Project/page_Manuscripts.php?izo=07549CB2-ECA1-4E7C-8360-3BE1288E0ACA&nCodeList=262&nAn=60 . \n Introduction to the Text \n “The Tale of Solomon and Kitovras” is part of a collection compiled by the priest-monk Efrosin of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery (St. Cyril of Beloozero’s Monastery) in the late 15th century CE. The monastery is located north of Moscow and originally functioned as a place of exile for elites and clergymen in disgrace. In 1446 CE, Grand Prince Vasily II came to the monastery, where the Father Superior, Tryphon, absolved him from the oath he had taken not to fight for the Muscovite throne. Following Vasily’s victory in the Muscovite Civil War, the Kirillo-Belozerky Monastery was granted special status and received an inflow of generous donations. The monastery became a place of broad intellectual activities and its prestige within the Muscovite state made it an attractive place for monks. It retained its high status through the reign of Grand Prince Ivan III (r. 1462-1505 CE) during which Efrosin composed the present text.  The manuscript, a book of encyclopedic content that includes writings from the Paleia , was part of Efrosin’s personal notebooks and may have been used for pedagogical purposes. It is absent from the book catalogue of the monastery’s library, which suggests that it was likely kept in Efrosin’s own cell.  The book is thick but compact, approximately 14 x 10 cm and covered in leather bindings.  Efrosin is one of the most remarkable men of letters of the Grand Duchy of Moscow but information about him is sparse. One of the few references to him outside his own notebooks mentions that he departed the monastery for over a year. In addition to religious texts, Efrosin’s collections include subjects such as geography, history, medicine, astronomy, and lexicography, and this breadth is representative of an encyclopedic trend in writings of the period. (See also Efrosin’s version of the “Tale of Dracula” in this sourcebook.) While Efrosin appears to have been in good standing with the Church, he did have a particular interest in texts, such as this story, which had been denounced as “false” or “of little use.” Of the texts he copied, he edited many to his own liking, with revisions, additions, and personal notes. In rewriting the texts in this manner, Efrosin often provided his own interpretations, thus creating original versions.  Efrosin’s creative synopsis of the “Tale of Solomon and Kitovras” is an original version of a longer tale which Efrosin had copied as part of the “Judgements of Solomon” cycle found in the Paleia , a major Old Russian interpretative text that retells much of the Old Testament with apocryphal additions and comments. Based on the image of the biblical king renowned for his wisdom and portrayed as a great holder of knowledge, tales of King Solomon formed a genre with a storied tradition that became a hallmark of Slavic Orthodox literary culture. Legends of Kitovras, a Slavic derivative of “Centaur”, occupy an important place in this tradition. Efrosin’s version takes considerable liberty with the tale and includes themes not present in his source, which he himself copied and included in the same book.  In the source version, Solomon captures Kitovras to help him with the construction of the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem. While held in captivity, Kitovras exhibits the ability to know the fates of several people. He tells Solomon how to obtain the Shamir stone needed to build the temple and stays with him through its completion. When Solomon doubts Kitovras’ strength, Kitovras throws him to the edge of the promised land. Upon his return, Solomon orders sixty bodyguards around his bed for protection against Kitovras.  In his edition, Efrosin added, for example, a description of the beast, but gave him cow legs instead of the horse legs depicted in the miniature drawn by the icon-painter Ephraim Trebes in section 127 of the same manuscript and in Nicetas of Heracleia’s commentary on Achilles and the Centaur, copied in the Kirillov Mythographer . The dialogue and Kitovras’s response to Solomon that, “Best of all is one’s own freedom,” is also Efrosin’s personal addition, and a deliberate choice for emphasis. Specialists have suggested that this line can be read in the context of the trend for monks, like Efrosin, to leave the monastery for extended periods of time, thereby living with a sense of independence that is reflected in the writings of the period as a whole. The modifications and additions that Efrosin made to the dialogue between Solomon and Kitovras and to the plot itself thus make his retelling stand out among other versions of this classic tale. \n Further Reading \n Likhachev, D.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Tale of Dracula the Voivode was produced in 1490 in the Kirillov-Beloozersky monastery near Beloozero (Belozersk), Russia. The monk Efrosin adapted the text from an unknown source. At the end of the text, he notes that he wrote an earlier version of the story in 1486 and rewrote it in 1490 (the 1486 version has not survived). The Tale  is part of a 500-folio manuscript codex in which Efrosin copied secular tales and diverse texts of encyclopedic content. Scholars consider the Tale  one of the first historical novels in Russian literature. Some believe that this text, along with Efrosin’s other writings, shows a Renaissance-like movement in Russian Orthodox religious culture in the late 15th century. The book in which the Tale  is included is one of only seven surviving manuscripts by Efrosin. They are held in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. For the text’s transcription and translation, I have used a digitization of the original manuscript #11/1088, fond 351, folio pages 204-217 of the Efrosin Collection at the Russian National Library. This digitization is available to view online here:  http://nlr.ru/manuscripts/RA1527/elektronnyiy-katalog?ab=07549CB2-ECA1-4E7C-8360-3BE1288E0ACA . \n Introduction to the Text \n The story of Dracula has become a signature piece of the Western literary canon thanks to Bram Stoker’s rendition of the centuries-old Eastern European tale. However, the original narrative, whose roots are believed to be from the Southern Slavic-speaking regions of Eastern Europe, is not a tale of love and everlasting life. It is an account of the life of Dracula’s prototype, the 15th-century Wallachian prince Vlad Tepes, whose merciless behavior as a voivode (warlord) led to the moniker Vlad the Impaler. The epithet Dracula is used in the text rather than the name Vlad. The origins of the moniker Dracula are still debated. The two leading explanations are that it is either a title denoting his father, Vlad Dracul’s, membership in the Order of the Dragon, or it is a derivation of the Romanian term drac with the meaning “son of the Devil.” [1]  The earliest Old Russian version of Vlad the Impaler’s life dates to 1486, when an Orthodox Monk, Efrosin, copied the story into one of his notebooks. There is no consensus on the origin of the story, but it is accepted that Efrosin’s is the earliest surviving copy. Specialists hypothesize that he could have received the source text from the infamous 15th-century Muscovite diplomat and heretic Fedor Kuritsyn. Kuritsyn could have taken the story from the court of the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. Others argue that Kuritsyn’s brother, Ivan Volk Kuritsyn, translated the story and passed it on to Efrosin. We know for sure that Efrosin’s rendition is the first Russian/East Slavic narrative of Vlad the Impaler’s devious deeds.  Efrosin’s manuscript demonstrates the diverse reading and writing culture of the Russian Orthodox monks at the Kirillov-Beloozersky (St. Cyril-Beloozero) monastery in northern Russia. Efrosin became a focus of Soviet and Russian medievalists when his collection of religious and secular texts was transferred from the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and placed in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg in 1918 (then the Russian Public Library). The manuscript in which Dracula  is found is one of only six miscellanies that have survived to the present day from Efrosin’s library. The manuscript represents the secular and private writings of the monk whom scholars describe as the monastery’s “academic bookman.” [2] Efrosin’s considerable personal collection of writings includes multiple secular tales. Furthermore, Robert Romanchuk, a specialist in philology, has argued that Efrosin’s secular manuscripts are unique and represent an “individual with an interest in ‘forbidden knowledge,” rather than an overarching intellectual trend among the Orthodox monks in the monastery. Another example of Efrosin’s interest in forbidden knowledge is The Tale of Solomon and Kitovras , which was later added to the same notebook.  Efrosin’s Dracula story highlights some of the most devilish and cunning examples of Vlad the Impaler’s rule as a warlord, including burning an entire group of people alive during a meal. The text underlines his cruelty and ascribes his damnation to his renunciation of Orthodoxy in favor of the Catholic “heresy.” The narrative also includes the seeds of what would become the modern vampire story: locals tell of Vlad the Impaler hunting, and purchasing mice and birds to impale, torture, and eat while he was imprisoned. The narrative highlights how he used his wit and intelligence to punish both the innocent and the guilty.  Beyond its connections to the modern Dracula lore, the text gives readers a glimpse of how Vlad the Impaler was viewed by his contemporaries in the region. The Efrosin manuscript was written less than two decades after Vlad’s death. The Russian version o..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Fūga wakashū imperial anthology was commissioned and compiled between 1344 and 1346 by retired Emperor Hanazono (1297-1348), the son of Eifuku Mon’in. The Fūga wakashū contains twenty volumes with a total of 2,210 poems. The anthology is the second and final imperial anthology to prominently feature Kyōgoku school poetry, the first being the Gyokuyō wakashū (c. 1313-14). It also features many poets from the Reizei poetry school.   It is notable that Hanazono involved himself to such an extent in the creation of the anthology. Normally, the emperor commissioning the work would have several compilers gather the poems, arrange them into sections, and make decisions on how to transcribe the poems, after which the emperor would inspect the final draft. Hanazono was trained by his mother Eifuku in the Kyōgoku style and personally knew many of the poets included in the collection. It is unsurprising, then, that Honazono compiled the anthology himself, not to mention his writing the Chinese and Japanese prefaces to the anthology.  Two of the earliest surviving manuscripts of the Fūga wakashū date back to a time roughly contemporary with the compilation of the text. One is a fragment stored in Tsurumi University’s Special Collections ; the other is a partial manuscript containing the seventeenth volume, which was transcribed by the Buddhist poet Ton’a, and which is stored at the Itsuō Art Museum in Ōsaka. A later manuscript, produced in the late Muromachi period, containing the tenth volume of Fūga wakashū (Love Book One) has been digitized and is viewable at the Kyoto Institute, Library, and Archives . An example of a digitized manuscript containing all volumes of the text can be found here . There are many examples of the text reproduced in woodblock print form during the Edo Period, such as this beautiful digitized book. Although the transmission of the text is fairly stable, variants between manuscripts exist. A list of Fūga wakashū manuscripts containing variants can be found on page iv of Iwasa Miyoko’s edition of the text (2004). \n Introduction to the Text \n Eifuku Mon’in (1271-1342), or Ex-empress Eifuku (also known as Saionji Kyōko), was born into the noble Saionji family. Along with her husband, Emperor Fushimi (1265-1317), she would prove to be one of the most important leaders in the development of waka poetry in the late Kamakura (1185-1333) and Nanbokuchō periods (1336-1392). The term waka (meaning literally “Japanese poem”) once described a variety of sub-forms of Japanese poetry, but, by the time Eifuku Mon’in was writing, it had come to primarily refer to the sub-form tanka , which consists of syllables in a pattern of 5-7-5-7-7.  The waka in the Global Medieval Sourcebook are all by Eifuku Mon’in and were taken from the “Love” sections of the Fūga wakashū (c. 1344-1346), an anthology of waka from various poets commissioned by Emperor Hanazono. The periodic commissioning of imperial poetry anthologies (or chokusen wakashū ) was an important element in the development of a poetic canon in premodern Japan. Each anthology was organized into sections related to a specific topic, such as “Spring,” “Travel,” “Winter,” or “Love.”  These waka give us insight into how deeply medieval Japanese poetry was tied to the public, political world, as well as how women found ways to participate in that public world. Waka in the aristocratic court had come to be dominated by the Nijō school, which advocated for a conservative approach to poetry. In the 1270s, sister and brother Kyōgoku Tameko and Tamekane trail-blazed a new style of writing waka, a style shorn of the rhetorical and allusive flourishes characteristic of Nijō writing in favor of more direct, even conversational, expressions of feeling. A poetry group known as the Kyōgoku school grew around this style. The two siblings became Emperor Fushimi’s tutors in 1280, forever cementing the bond between the Kyōgoku school and Fushimi’s side of the imperial family, the Jimyōin line. This line was one half of a struggle between two branches of the imperial family claiming the throne; thus, the prestige of the Kyōgoku school and the presence of their poems in the imperial poetry anthologies would rise and fall with the fate of the Jimyōin emperors.  Eifuku Mon’in, having married into the this imperial line, found herself the defender of both the Jimyōin line and the Kyōgoku school after its earlier members, including her husband, had died or been exiled. By personally training a large number of future emperors and empresses, noblemen and noblewomen, Eifuku Mon’in led the Kyōgoku school and secured its legacy, all while producing some of the best poetry of the period. The indispensability of her leadership for the Kyōgoku school is attested by her being the poet with the second highest number of poems in the Fūga wakashū , the highest number reserved for the Fushimi out of traditional reverence for the emperor.

Hanazono was trained by his mother Eifuku in the Kyōgoku style and personally knew many of the poets included in the collection. It is unsurprising, then, that Honazono compiled the anthology himself, not to mention his writing the Chinese and Japanese prefaces to the anthology.

Along with her husband, Emperor Fushimi (1265-1317), she would prove to be one of the most important leaders in the development of waka poetry in the late Kamakura (1185-1333) and Nanbokuchō periods (1336-1392). The term waka (meaning literally “Japanese poem”) once described a variety of sub-forms of Japanese poetry, but, by the time Eifuku Mon’in was writing, it had come to primarily signify the sub-form tanka , which consists of syllables in a pattern of 5-7-5-7-7.  The waka in the Global Medieval Sourcebook are all by Eifuku Mon’in and were taken from the “Love” sections of the Fūga wakashū (c. 1344-1346), an anthology of waka from various poets commissioned by Emperor Hanazono. The periodic commissioning of imperial poetry anthologies (or chokusen wakashū ) was an important element in the development of a poetic canon in premodern Japan. Each anthology was organized into sections related to a specific topic, such as “Spring,” “Travel,” “Winter,” or “Love.”  These waka give us insight into how deeply medieval Japanese poetry was tied to the public, political world, as well as how women found ways to participate in that public world. Waka in the aristocratic court had come to be dominated by the Nijō school, which advocated for a conservative approach to poetry. In the 1270s, sister and brother Kyōgoku Tameko and Tamekane trail-blazed a new style of writing waka, a style shorn of the rhetorical and allusive flourishes characteristic of Nijō writing in favor of more direct, even conversational, expressions of feeling. A poetry group known as the Kyōgoku school grew around this style. The two siblings became Emperor Fushimi’s tutors in 1280, forever cementing the bond between the Kyōgoku school and Fushimi’s side of the imperial family, the Jimyōin line. This line was one half of a struggle between two branches of the imperial family claiming the throne; thus, the prestige of the Kyōgoku school and the presence of their poems in the imperial poetry anthologies would rise and fall with the fate of the Jimyōin emperors.  Eifuku Mon’in, having married into the this imperial line, found herself the defender of both the Jimyōin line and the Kyōgoku school after its earlier members, including her husband, had died or been exiled. By personally training a large number of future emperors and empresses, noblemen and noblewomen, Eifuku Mon’in led the Kyōgoku school and secured its legacy, all while producing some of the best poetry of the period. The indispensability of her leadership for the Kyōgoku school is attested by her being the poet with the second highest number of poems in the Fūga wakashū , the highest number reserved for the Fushimi out of traditional reverence for the emperor.

This particular version was written in the thirteenth century in Venice or the Veneto and is preserved in Berlin in Staatsbibliothek, Preußischer Kulturbesitz, MS Ham. 390 f.49v alongside another mantic alphabet published in the GMS as well as other divinatory and oracular texts.  Below the alphabet on the page an illustrator has included a diagram of how the dreambook functions. A small figure is shown asleep and dreaming (labeled iste dormit ) and then is shown sitting awake before a group of friends as he excitedly explains his dream with the help of a book open on his lap (labeled hic splanat somnia ). \n Introduction to the Text \n This short text is one of many so-called “dreambooks” - personal guides to dream interpretation - that flourished across Europe and Byzantium in the late Middle Ages. This particular example is a mantic alphabet known as a Somniale Ioseph , named for Joseph, the Old Testament dream interpreter. Like a similar mantic alphabet contained in the same manuscript and also published in the GMS , it is designed to be used alongside another text. A reader wishing to interpret a dream opens a book, often a psalter or prayer book, at random and stops at the first letter that they see. Turning back to the Somniale Ioseph, then, they read the entry corresponding to that letter.  This text differs from other kinds of alphabetical dreambooks, such as the tradition known as Somniale Danielis, which listed themes and images from dreams alongside interpretations. This text instead introduces a note of chance, drawing on the long history of bibliomancy (fortune-telling with books) in the Middle Ages.  Dream interpretation was a popular pastime in the Middle Ages and hundreds of manuscript copies of dreambooks, drawn from Arabic, Byzantine, Greek, and Hebrew sources, survive alongside those written in Latin and vernacular European languages. \n Further Reading \n Chardonnens, László Sándor.  “Dream Divination in Manuscripts and Early Printed Books: Patterns of Transmission.” Aspects of Knowledge: Preserving and Reinventing Traditions of Learning in the Middle Ages , edited by Marilina Cesario and Hugh Magennis.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n While Folz himself printed many of his own works (he operated his own small printing operation), he did not print this song (or any of his other Meisterlieder). The source survives in a late-fifteenth-century manuscript, possibly in Folz’s own hand, containing a number of Folz’s Meisterlieder, Shrovetide plays, and treatises on theology, fencing, and alchemy. The manuscript also contains a number of poems by the fourteenth-century poet Heinrich von Mügeln. \n Introduction to the Text \n The Gutenberglied (Song of Gutenberg) is a song composed sometime before 1480 by the Nuremberg poet and barber surgeon Hans Folz (ca. 1437–1513). The song is an example of the genre of the Meisterlied (master song), a form of art song prevalent in various German cities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These vernacular songs were typically created by artisans who composed new texts according to strict rules concerning rhyme, meter, and word choice. They set these texts to existing melodies and performed them in meetings of poets’ guilds.  This song is especially interesting as one of the earliest texts commenting on Johannes Gutenberg’s recent introduction in Europe of printing with movable type, which set the stage for the mass production and distribution of books, pamphlets, and other forms of printed works. Folz’s song is both supportive and suspicious of the new technology. Folz praises print for spreading the word of God, as print has made copies of the Bible more affordable for monasteries. However, he also criticizes it for allowing those who deny God—particularly the Jews—to spread their ideas. On balance, Folz concludes, print is a positive development and Gutenberg deserves praise for his invention. \n Further Reading \n Baldzuhn, Michael. “The Companies of Meistergesang in Germany.” The Reach of the Republic of Letters: Literary and Learned Societies in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe , edited by Arjan van Dixhoorn and Susie Speakman Sutch, Brill, 2008, pp. 219–55.     •   Introduction to genre of master song.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n “La pucele” exists in three different manuscripts, each of which is a compilation of fabliaux and similar short verse tales. Each version of the tale is largely the same, but with some differences in details. The manuscripts are Bern, Burgerbibliothek 354, folio 43ra-44ra (Witness B); Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, fr. 1593, folio 187rb-188ra (Witness E); and Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, fr. 25545, folio 4vb-5vb (Witness I). This edition follows the witness naming conventions found in the Nouveau Recueil Complet des Fabliaux ( NRCF ). The longest of the three manuscripts is I, which has a 26 verse epilogue, compared to 7 verses in B and 9 in E. Each text shows evidence of divergences from what scholars assume to have been the (now lost)   original text. The critical text, which we have drawn from the NRCF , tracks most closely with B, despite some omissions in B.  Of the three manuscripts, B is the most legible and most well-preserved, despite some holes in the parchment. E is nearly as legible as B. I is the least legible, showing signs of multiple repairs to the manuscript, irregularly lined columns, and multiple illegible sections due to faded or scraped ink. B has red and blue initials and rubrics in a pale red. E has spaces reserved for miniatures and other decorations that were never completed. I uses red ink for majuscules and rubrics.  In all three manuscripts, the fabliau’s author is unnamed. The text is also difficult to date or locate with any precision. Each manuscript is believed to be from the late 13 th or early 14 th century. I has been dated most precisely as between the end of 1316 and April 3, 1317. As a result, the original date for the composition of “La pucele” is suspected to be sometime in the mid- to late 13 th century. \n Introduction to the Text \n Fabliaux are a genre of short tales in verse from late medieval France, which were written and performed by jongleurs, a type of minstrel. Joseph Bédier provides the classic definition of the genre as “contes à rire en vers” [stories in verse to laugh at]. The typical metrical form of the fabliau is octosyllabic rhymed couplets, the most common verse form in medieval French literature. Fabliaux are often obscene, full of scatological and sexual humor; many feature rape and other forms of sexual violence that can be quite graphic and disturbing. They also often express strong anticlerical and anti-nobility sentiments.  “La pucele qui voloit voler” (“The girl who wanted to fly”) is highly representative of the genre in its themes, plot, style, and characters. In this poem, a beautiful and courtly maiden ( la pucele ) is pursued by a group of suitors, all of whom she rejects. One day, she announces that she would like to be able to fly. Several young men construct wings for her, which do not work. One day, a cleric ( li clers ) convinces her that she needs a beak and a tail to fly, as all birds possess these things. He offers to make them for her, to which she readily assents. The two close themselves in a room and the clerk begins to kiss her “more than thirty times,” explaining that he is fashioning the beak. Then, he begins work on the tail, at which the lady expresses pleasure. Both the beak and the tail exemplify the use of euphemism and misnaming common in fabliaux . Norris J. Lacy writes that, in fabliaux, the “refusal to call things by their ordinary names will lead directly to the precise result, usually sexual intercourse, that the euphemisms were designed to preclude” (44). “La pucele” is no exception. When the lady in this tale learns that the clerk won’t be able to complete her tail in less than a year, she keeps him with her so she can achieve her goal of flying. Naturally, the lady becomes pregnant; she then complains that the clerk tricked her. He explains to her, however, that her pregnancy is entirely natural. It was her wish to fly that was unnatural. The lesson of the tale, then, is that people who have excessive or outrageous desires will pay the consequences. \n Further Reading \n Bédier, Joseph.

    "textauthor": "Hermann Greven",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n This spiritual biography was written between 1450 and 1479 by Hermann Greven (Hermannus Gresgenius), a Carthusian monk in Cologne. It is part of a martyrology, or catalogue of martyrs and saints, authored by Greven and based on a ninth-century text by the monk Usuard. The present translation is based on the Latin edition in the Acta sanctorum . More information on the text and the original manuscript is available here . \n Introduction to the Text \n This spiritual biography (or vita ) concerns the life and sanctity of a woman named Haseka, a recluse in the church of Schermbeck, in today’s North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The author praises Haseka’s pious way of life and inclination against human company before describing a miracle in which Haseka (through God’s intervention) changes rancid butter into fresh, and then relating the conflict between monasteries over the right to bury Haseka’s dead body. Once finally buried, Haseka appears to a widow in her sleep. The vita ends by foretelling the popular veneration of this holy recluse.  As a recluse, Haseka adopted a type of religious life which centred around her physical enclosure inside a small dwelling. This form of life existed throughout the European Middle Ages; terms for such enclosed, devotional people include anchorite, anchoress, and solitary. In the later Middle Ages it was common, as in Haseka’s case, for women recluses to live in a house or cell attached to a parish church. The recluse was expected to lead an exemplary holy life and pray for the souls of those who offered her donations and alms. Frequently, recluses could also exercise a kind of charismatic authority, offering advice or teachings to interested passersby.  Since recluses were bound to their dwellings, they needed the support of outsiders to stay alive and to minister to their daily needs. It is interesting to note the prominent role played by Haseka’s attendant in this spiritual biography. The author calls her “Sister Berta”, and does not call her a servant as such but rather “ministra”. He also portrays her as very close to the recluse: Berta has influence over Haseka’s goods (when she tries to remove the rancid butter), and eats with her at the same table. Both Berta, the recluse’s attendant, and the nameless, pious widow, to whom the postmortem Haseka appears, suggest a rich landscape of non-cloistered religious women, existing alongside recluses and monasteries in this period. \n Further Reading \n Grundmann, Herbert. “Deutsche Eremiten, Einsiedler und Klausner im Hochmittelalter (10.–12.

    "textauthor": "Simon Grunau",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This text is an excerpt from  Simon Grunau’s Preussische Chronik  , or Prussian Chronicle. The text is written in the Early New High German language ( Frühneuhochdeutsch) , and scholars believe that it was completed by around 1530. It was composed in Prussia (which today spans northern Poland and Russia’s Kaliningrad Oblast), most likely in the vicinity of Gdańsk.   Little is known about the author Simon Grunau. He was a Dominican friar, born in Tolkmitsk in Prussia (which is near today’s Elbląg, Poland). He seems to have lived most of his life in Gdańsk, where he was particularly active preaching amongst the burghers. At the time when Grunau was writing, the position of the Dominican Order in Prussia was uncertain, not least due to the spread of Lutheranism across Prussia during the 1520s. The Lutheran Reformation had quickly reached and taken hold in Prussia, and this was a key concern for Grunau, not only due to Luther’s rejection of papal authority and monasticism, but also the social and doctrinal changes emerging as a result of Luther’s confrontation with the Catholic Church. In 1525, the Teutonic Order, the religious military order who had governed the majority of Prussia since the mid-thirteenth century, converted to Lutheranism and transformed their Catholic monastic state into a secular Lutheran Duchy. The impacts of these events are reflected in Grunau’s chronicle, highlighted by his open hostility to both Lutheranism and Duke Albert of Prussia (the first Duke of Prussia, and previous Grandmaster (leader) of the Teutonic Order).   Grunau’s chronicle purports to give an account of the history of Prussia from the beginning of time until around 1530, and as such contains a wide variety of socioeconomic, religious and political narratives. In addition to exploring the pre-Christian lives of the Prussians and the religious changes mentioned above, Grunau interweaves passages concerning economic themes such as taxation and price and currency fluctuations, as well as political themes such as relations between Prussia, Poland and the Holy Roman Empire.   The chronicle is a compilation of material from numerous sources, both narrative (other chronicles such as that of Peter von Dusburg) and documentary (such as the Treaty of Christburg, a legal and peace agreement between the Teutonic Order and Prussian tribes ), as well as Grunau’s own experiences and material likely invented or seriously embellished by Grunau himself. As a result, its reliability and veracity are in question, and Grunau’s chronicle has often been wrongly dismissed as unworthy of study for this reason. There are numerous lines of enquiry still open with Grunau’s work, not least with respect to why and how he embellished his material, and what new narratives and identities he created in doing so.  The excerpt included in the Global Medieval Sourcebook  is an interesting account of the supposed pantheon of gods worshipped by the pre-Christian Prussians before the thirteenth century, combined with details of how they came to be deified and what exactly their worship entailed. Within this there are several elements: first, the obviously ritualistic elements of the “ pagan ”  worship of these gods, with gruesome sacrifice and quasi-ghostlike hauntings; second, the more worldly offerings Grunau suggests (such as various crops and animals), providing information about food and drink either found in Prussia or commonly known to his readers at the time. Finally, Grunau explores the foundation mythology of the Prussian people (the “ Cimbri ”  and “ Bruteni ” ), in attempts to reimagine Prussian identity and heritage in a period of intense conflict and division. It is this external imagining of a different religion and culture which is most interesting, and the way in which Grunau uses it to delineate a Prussian identity. These are themes which are still incredibly relevant today. By studying embellished or imagined narratives, we can better understand the agendas of those writing them.  \n Further Reading \n Bojtar, E., Foreword to the past: A Cultural History of the Baltic People .

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n This version of Guillaume de Nangis’s text is included in the  Grandes Chroniques de France made for John II of France ( British Library-Royal MS 16 G VI ). These royal chronicles blend historical and mythological elements, functioning as a source of political legitimacy for both the Capetian and Valois dynasties of French monarchs. \n Introduction to the Text \n This translated excerpt comes from Guillaume de Nangis’s  Life of St. Louis produced near Paris around 1300 CE. Pre-dating Louis’s more famous biography by Jean de Joinville, the chronicle celebrates the life, accomplishments and sometimes miraculous abilities of the famous king who was canonized in 1297. The version presented here recounts an episode during the French king’s final crusade, an expedition into Tunisia as part of the Eighth Crusade (1270).  According to the text, King Louis IX had been invited to Tunisia by the “king of Tunis”—the Hafsid ruler al-Mustansir, who promised to convert to Christianity. However, upon the arrival of Louis’s forces, the Islamic leader reneges on his word. After sacking Carthage, the crusader army returns and sets up camp. Three “Saracens” (a medieval pejorative term that racialized Muslims) approach John of Acre, the butler of France, claiming that they want to convert to Christianity. Suddenly, a different, larger group of Muslims conducts a surprise attack, killing many Christians. John drags the first group before King Louis where their leader claims that he had no part in the ambush, insisting that his political rival committed this treachery. The king does not believe their story but releases them and orders the construction of defenses around the camp to prevent future assaults. The “Saracen commander” is received by his own camp with a warm welcome, suggesting that conversion was never really his intention.  While scholars agree that al-Mustansir may have considered converting for his own political purposes, there remains discussion about how to read the relationship between the text and the image that accompanies it on Royal MS 16 G VI f.442r (see icon image; a larger resolution image can be viewed here ). I have recently argued that this section of the manuscript serves as an allegory of al-Mustansir’s actions, as well as a Latin Christian polemic on the duplicity of “Saracens” writ large. It is notable that the Hafsid Muslims depicted on 440v and 442r are the only “shoeless Saracens” in the entirety of the manuscript, suggesting that illuminators wanted to cast these figures as particularly barbarous for their inadvertent role in Louis’s death. Indeed, the heraldic motifs on the “Saracen” shield further dehumanize the Muslims by affiliating them with either pigs or dogs. \n Further Reading \n Viard, Jules.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The text transcribed here is not medieval; rather, it is a lithograph produced in Mumbai in 1907. This is one of at least two lithographed poems—the other being a Farāmarznāma, narrating the exploits of Borzin’s father—produced under the direction of Rostam Pur-e Bahrām Sorush-e Tāfti. Sorush-e Tāfti was an Indian Parsi who traveled throughout India and Iran in search of antique manuscripts relating to the Sistāni heroes. According to Rahim ‘Afifi, editor of the only scholarly edition of the Bahmannāmeh, the lithograph is primarily based on an otherwise unidentified manuscript from 1667. At least four other manuscripts are known, the earliest dated to 1397-98 CE. \n Introduction to the Text \n Likely completed between 1092 and 1108 CE, the Bahmannāma (“Book of Bahman”) is the work of a poet so obscure that even his name is not certain. Though there is a general consensus around the form Irānshāh ebn-e Abi-l-Khayr, the first element is spelled “Irānshān” or even “Inshān” in some manuscripts. Dedications in the text to the Seljuq sultans Nāser ad-Din Mahmud ebn-e Malekshāh and Ghiyās ad-Din Mohammad ebn-e Malekshāh position him within the Seljuq Empire around the turn of the 12th century CE.    Irānshāh is credited with another epic work, the Kushnāma (“Book of Kush”). Both of the poems offer revisionist takes on the New Persian epic tradition established by the monumental Shāhnāma (“Book of Kings,” 1010 CE) of Abolqāsem Ferdowsi. This Book drew upon Persian legend, Zoroastrian religious tradition, and Arabic historiography to craft an immense saga of Iran’s pre-Islamic past, from the first king Gayomart down to the Muslim conquests of the 7th century CE. Subsequent epic poets adopted the Shāhnāma ’s meter and diction, often situating their narratives in gaps within the earlier poem’s millennia-long scope—a practice literalized by later scribes, who often incorporated segments of these poems seamlessly into Shāhnāma manuscripts.   In the Bahmannāma , Irānshāh centers not the usual epic heroes but rather a villain, the tyrannical King Bahman. Known for his bloody vengeance against the family of the Sistāni champion Rostam, Bahman is an overbearing, homicidal tyrant. Frequently defeated in battle, he is ultimately devoured by a serpentine monster, an azhdahā , making him the only epic character who fails to overcome such a beast.   Before this shocking finale, however, the poem features another encounter with an azhdahā . In this excerpt, the hero Borzin-Āzar (“Exalted Flame,” usually just called Borzin), son of Farāmarz (“Beyond-the-Border”), and grandson of Rostam, takes a break from his struggle against Bahman. Together with his companions, Marzbān (“Margrave”) and Tokhāra (“The Tokharian”), he sets out on a hunting expedition. Along the way, they encounter a lion-hunting youth who directs them to a large nomadic encampment with abundant livestock. The lord of the herds is Burāsp, who in the course of a lavish welcome feast reveals that the lion-hunting youth is his daughter. This warrior maiden will only marry the man who can overcome her father’s champion wrestler, a Black African man ( zangi ), and then defeat her in a joust. Borzin accomplishes these feats, but before the wedding, Burāsp reveals the reason behind this warlike courtship. Every year, he is forced to deliver his daughter up to a sexually rapacious cloud; if he fails, his livestock will be slaughtered. Horrified, Borzin witnesses this ritual. He then pursues the cloud back to its mountain lair, where it reveals itself as a monstrous beast. Borzin kills it, and the excerpt ends with a celebratory feast at the court of Burāsp’s brother, the king of Pārs.  Violence and eroticism entwine throughout this passage. One key word is azhdahā , a chimeric reptilian beast with anthropomorphic qualities, translated here as “dragon.” This first appears in this edition’s line 111, as a metaphor for the warrior princess; then, in 204, it describes Borzin as he overcomes her. These figurative usages are juxtaposed against the literal monster which terrorizes the young woman and her kingdom, itself killed by one final azhdahā—Borzin’s sword.  Irānshāh’s poetry invests in depictions of alterity that are both denigrated and desired. The African wrestler is a key figure in this project. Denied dialogue or even a name, his portrayal is a stark example of the anti-Blackness prevalent in Persian epic literature. He exists only to be overcome, even if the text here tacitly endorses Borzin’s chivalrous smackdown over Tokhāra’s outspoken bigotry. Yet verbal echoes link all of these figures—Borzin, the princess, the wrestler, and the monster. All are enmeshed in economies of violence that complicate simplistic narratives of culture heroes triumphing over the forces of chaos.   Neither of Irānshāh’s epics have been translated into English or other European languages, and scholarly discussion of them remains scant. \n Further Reading \n Hanaw..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Han Yu 韓愈 (768-824 CE), also known as Tuizhi 退之, was a scholar, official, poet, and a highly influential literary figure during the Tang dynasty (619-907 CE) of China. He played an important role in the development of Confucian thought, especially the Confucian revival movement. This school of thought, often referred to as ‘Neo-Confucianism’ or Daoxue 道學 (‘Learning of the Way’), became very influential in the centuries following Han Yu’s death, its impact extending far beyond philosophical abstraction to shape literary and historical works, economic and social policy, and law during the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE). Han Yu's major contribution to this movement lay in providing Confucian thought with practical responses to the cultural and philosophical impacts of Buddhism and Daoism, and in popularizing a literary language, guwen 古文 (‘the language of antiquity’), which claimed a basis in the Confucian canon of the Zhou dynasty (c.1046-256 BCE) and therefore eschewed the influence of Buddhist writings. In his most famous work, Essentials of the Moral Way , Han Yu proposed a political, social and economic program intended to place the Confucian classics at the center of life, with society arranged around a strong and virtuous imperial center.  The Memorial on the Bones of the Buddha is a memorial, that is, a report to the emperor. It was submitted by Han Yu to Emperor Xianzong 憲宗 (r. 806-820 CE) in 819 CE in response to Xianzong's proposal to parade Buddhist relics usually kept at the Famen Temple—more specifically, a bone from the Buddha’s finger—around his territory. The tone of Han Yu’s appeal is elegant but vehement, and has been celebrated as an example of prose style. His memorial contrasts the ‘Chinese’ teachings of the ancients, which he claims are proven to provide longevity, against the ‘foreign’ doctrines of a ‘foreign’ figure (the Buddha). He argues that the Buddha’s relics can only bring impurity and instability and claims that his teachings have led to turbulent and deficient imperial governance.  One interesting aspect for modern readers is how Han Yu treats Buddhism as an instrument of rulership rather than as a faith or belief system, and seeks to demonstrate that its teachings cannot rival the ancient ways. His characterization of the Buddha as a foreigner is based on customs—clothing, food and language. The portrayal of Buddhism as a corrupting influence from the outside was quite extreme and does not seem to have been typical of the period, but it should be noted that the relic was not paraded again for more than fifty years—until 873 CE.  The tone of Han Yu’s memorial was not welcomed by the emperor. While serving as Vice-President of the Board of Justice, Han Yu had previously published stark criticism of Daoism and Buddhism in his essay Yuandao 原道 ('An Examination of the Way'), with only limited impact. This time, however, his criticism of the imperial center through the condemnation of previous Buddhist dynasties infuriated the emperor. Han Yu only narrowly escaped with his life and was exiled to the southern province of Chaozhou, although on the death of Xianzong a year later he was able to return to the capital and subsequently occupied several senior roles in the civil service. \n Further Reading \n Chan, Wing-Tsit.

    "title": "Junius Peperit Charm | Maria virgo peperit Christum\n",
    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Junius Childbirth Charm is transmitted in the manuscript Oxford Bodleian Library, MS Junius 85/86, an eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon manuscript containing Lenten sermons, including dialogues between the body and soul. It is one of four childbirth charms written into the spaces between sermons. It is worth noting that the childbirth charms in this manuscript contain the first known occurrence of the sequence of the holy mothers. \n Introduction to the Text \n Childbirth in medieval Europe was often the most dangerous experience of a woman's life. Because of poor hygiene and a lack of gynecological knowledge, scholars have estimated that as many as ten percent of women died during childbirth or immediately afterwards. Not only did mothers die in large numbers, but as many as thirty percent of children died in the process of childbirth. In the face of these dangers, medieval people used a wide variety of charms and prayers in an attempt to improve their chances of a successful delivery.  The charm presented here was composed in England in the eleventh century CE and is an example of a “peperit charm”. The name comes from the Latin word peperit (“gave birth to”). This word occurs frequently in these charms, because they list the biblical women who gave birth to children. Indeed, a peperit charm can be identified by its sequence of holy mothers, one of the most widespread motifs in medieval childbirth charms. Typically, as is the case here, a peperit charm will invoke the names of holy mothers one by one. Some examples will contain other formulations, whether to add to the functions to the charm or to enhance its effects. This charm contains three additional features that can be found in other childbirth charms: an appeal to the unborn child to leave the womb; the account of Lazarus’s resurrection with its climactic words, “Lazarus, come forth!”; instructions for how to turn the prayer into an amulet that the laboring woman can wear on her body.  In the case of the Junius Peperit Charm , the instructions for turning the prayer into an amulet state that the charm should be written on wax that has never been used before and bound to the woman’s right foot. The requirement for unworked wax (also known as “virgin” wax) is interesting, seeming to emphasize the sacramental quality of the prayer. The instruction to attach the prayer to the pregnant woman's body suggests that there was a hope that she could connect with its content in an embodied way, drawing on its power to support her own body during childbirth.  In comparison to childbirth prayers, an example of which is presented in this collection https://sourcebook.stanford.edu/text/marston-childbirth-prayer , this charm has minimal narrative content, focusing instead on the invocation of biblical names. It is quite possible that this charm, or at least the first part of it, would have been repeatedly chanted during a woman's labor. Hearing the familiar names of biblical mothers might have served to calm and encourage the laboring woman, reassuring her that she too could deliver her child safely. \n Further Reading \n Wood, Diana.

    "textauthor": "Li Qingzhao 李清照",
    "body": " 夜來沉醉卸妝遲。 At night, I was drunk and did not take off my makeup. 梅萼插殘枝。 The plum blossom petals withered on the twig. 酒醒熏破春睡， As I sobered up, their smell broke the spring sleep; 夢斷不成歸。 the dream ended before I was able to reach home.  人悄悄， There was no sound of people, 月依依。 The moon lingered on, 翠簾垂。 The emerald curtain rolled down. 更挼殘蕊， Again, I pinched the leftover petals, 更撚餘香， Again, I rubbed the remaining fragrance, 更得些時。 Again, I obtained some more time. \n Introduction to the Text \n This is another melancholic ci which plays with the image of withering plum blossoms to evoke the passage of time and the impermanence of happiness.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of ci but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre.  In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dynasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry. Following the invasion of Kaifeng, she moved first to Nanjing and then to Lin’an, where she spent the remaining decades of her life; her husband died in 1129. In contrast to the love themes of her earlier ci, much of her later poetry is concerned with the sorrow of her forced migration and her personal loneliness in her new surroundings. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

These displays are practiced beforehand in “lantern trials.”, 踏雪沒心情。 I am not in the mood to walk through the snow. \n Introduction to the Text \n Li Qingzhao wrote in a note accompanying this ci that it was inspired by Ouyang Xiu’s “To the tune of ‘Butterfly love’', which she greatly admired. Both ci have a similar theme--the speaker's regret--and share a similar opening image of a courtyard (in Ouyang Xiu's version: 'The courtyard is deep, how many layers of depth are there?”).

Like other ci which she composed, it captures the loneliness of a speaker whose feelings jar against the happy scenes around her. In this case, the mention of the festival of Double Ninth (a harvest festival associated with expressions of gratitude) emphasises her alienation. Festivals such as this were occasions to gather together and socialize, but here we encounter the speaker entirely alone.

It may be inspired by Li Qingzhao's separations from her husband due to his work. The poet's vivid portrayal of listlessness (a jewellery box gathering dust, incense cooling in the holder) suggests that stasis is produced when love is suspended.

    "body": " 昨夜雨疏風驟。 Last night, the rain was sparse and the wind was strong; 濃睡不消殘酒。 deep sleep did not absorb the remaining wine. 試問卷簾人， I asked the one who was rolling up the curtainThis refers to a female domestic servant.: 卻道海棠依舊。 she only said that the flowering crabapple was the same as before. 知否。 Don’t you know? 知否。 Don’t you know? 應是綠肥紅瘦。 The greens should be fat and the reds should be thinThe idea is that after the wash of rain and wind, the crabapple should be filled with green leaves and there should be fewer red flowers than before… \n Introduction to the Text \n This ci is one of Li Qingzhao’s earlier works. As in other compositions by her, images of nature (in this case, a crabapple tree after a rainstorm) are the site for exploring the poet-speaker’s state of mind and her connection with, or alienation from, the world around her.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as “song lyrics.” This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, “graceful”) and háofàng (豪放, “bold”). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of ci but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre.  In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dynasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry. Following the invasion of Kaifeng, she moved first to Nanjing and then to Lin’an, where she spent the remaining decades of her life; her husband died in 1129. In contrast to the love themes of her earlier ci, much of her later poetry is concerned with the sorrow of her forced migration and her personal loneliness in her new surroundings. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

    "body": " 聲聲慢 To the tune “Note after Note, Long Song” 尋尋覓覓， Looking and searching, looking and searching, 冷冷清清， cold and quiet, cold and quiet, 淒淒慘慘戚戚。 lonesome, dismayed, and desolate; lonesome, dismayed, and desolate. 乍暖還寒時候， At the time when it has just turned warm yet is still quite cold, 最難將息。 it is the hardest for one to rest. 三杯兩盞淡酒， How can two or three cups of weak wine 怎敵他、 shield one from 晚來風急。 the harsh wind in the evening? 雁過也， The wild geese have flown past; 正傷心， what truly pains the heart, 卻是舊時相識。 is that I knew them from the past. 滿地黃花堆積。 Yellow flowers pile all over the ground, 憔悴損， withered and wilted. 如今有誰堪摘。 Now who would pluck them? 守著窗兒， I guard the window; 獨自怎生得黑。 how do I endure this darkness by myself? 梧桐更兼細雨， The parasol tree in the slight rain 到黃昏、 at dusk, 點點滴滴。 dripping and drizzling, dripping and drizzling. 這次第， In such circumstances, 怎一個愁字了得。 how could the single word “sorrow” suffice? \n Introduction to the Text \n This ci uses repetition to evoke the relentlessness of the speaker's sorrow, for which language is insufficient (see the final line). The political trauma of the end of the Northern Song dynasty--which forced Li Qingzhao's own migration to the south--seems intertwined with the speaker's personal doubts, one amplifying the other to yield a bleak picture where the only certainty is suffering.

At the same time, the changing weather and the changing seasons emphacize the speaker's literal powerlessness in the world, in which she is only an observer. Art (the playing of a zither, which may remind us of the poet's own composition of ci ) emerges as a possible human act in the face of uncontrollable change and the unstoppable march of time.

    "body": " 漁家傲 To the tune “The Fisherman is Proud” 天接雲濤連曉霧。 The sky merged the sea of clouds濤 literally means a wave, i.e. a wave of clouds. with the mist of dawn. 星河欲轉千帆舞。 The starry rivers swirled as if a thousand sails fluttered.  彷佛夢魂歸帝所。 I felt as if my dreaming soul had returned to the gods’ palaceIt is unclear which gods are referred to here; in the Buddhist tradition of the Tang Dynasty, people believed in an emperor who inhabited a palace in the sky and was surrounded by a court of other gods. In some ancient Chinese mythology, there is an idea that the soul originates in the sky and ultimately returns to the sky.: 聞天語。 I heard the sky speak, 殷勤問我歸何處。 asking me repeatedly, where do I belong? 我報路長嗟日暮。 I replied that the road was long and the sun about to set. 學詩漫有驚人句。 I learnt poetry and wrote astonishing lines in vain. 九萬里風鵬正舉。 The Peng birdThe Peng bird is an enormous bird of legend, notably depicted in an influential philosophical work, the Zhuangzi, written by Zhuangzi (B.C. 369-B.C. 286), the Taoist philosopher with the same name. glided in the wind, soaring nine thousand miles into the sky 風休住。 O, wind, please do not stop, 蓬舟吹取三山去。 blow this tumbleweed boat to the Three MountainsThe Three Mountains was the name given to the place where immortals were believed to live… \n Introduction to the Text \n This ci is usually interpreted as a dream vision, where the speaker experiences a brief taste of the afterlife: a beautiful palace in the sky where the immortal dwell. This may be of particular interest to readers more familiar with medieval Christian, Jewish, and Muslim beliefs about life after death.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Li Qingzhao was probably one of the most prominent female poets in Imperial China. Born into an elite family of imperial bureaucrats, Li Qingzhao aspired to become a writer even though literature was considered a male domain. She quickly gained fame for her poetic talent and became not only a celebrated composer of ci but also an important critic of the genre. In her view, the male poets composing lyrics for female singers struggled to convey these women’s thoughts and voices convincingly. In her song lyrics, Li Qingzhao offers the modern reader something rare and precious: the inner world of women in medieval China, as imagined by a woman poet. Her songs are often considered to be among the most affecting of the genre.  In 1127, when Li Qingzhao was in her forties, the capital city of the Song dynasty (present-day Kaifeng)—the city where Li Qingzhao lived—was conquered by the Jin dynasty in the Jin-Song Wars, along with the northern half of the Song dynasty’s territory. The surviving members of the dynasty consolidated their regime in the south, establishing a new capital city, first in Nanjing, then in Lin’an (present-day Hangzhou). The conquest of Kaifeng marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty: two distinct eras in the political history of China, and two distinctive periods in Li Qingzhao’s own poetry.

In the first stanza, she considers their visual impact: how the trees block the sunlight; the way their leaves resemble hearts. The speaker's own heartbreak is signalled at the start of the second stanza, in which the poet evokes the sound of rain dripping from the banana leaves and the discontent that it provokes. The characterization of the speaker as a 'northerner' suggests that this ci may be conveying the poet's own feelings: she was forced to move to the south following the conquest of Kaifeng and the collapse of the Northern Song dynasty.

The tone is wistful, and although much of the imagery pertains to the beautiful natural scenery, it also seems to evoke the theme of the tune that the ci is set to (“Yearning for the Prince”): a sense of aloneness, even a longing for absent friends.

The second stanza describes her intention to travel to a place where spring is still in full bloom, but also her doubts about the possibility of casting off her unhappiness.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The National Library of Portugal (BNL) holds the manuscript from which the Prologue was transcribed and translated. The BNL catalogue dates the manuscript to 1475-1525. (The online catalogue entry can be viewed here .) Before this manuscript arrived at the BNL, it was in the possession of a Jesuit College in Évora, Portugal, the College of the Holy Spirit.  This manuscript comprises two chronicles by Fernão Lopes, the Chronicle of Peter I and the Chronicle of Ferdinand I , both written with the same hand. It can be viewed online here . Unfortunately, no surviving copy from the time of its production remains (c. 1440), but there are a few other copies made in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, between the years of 1525 and 1600. The presence of these early modern manuscripts, written with different hands, indicates that manuscript versions of the Chronicle of Peter I still circulated in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. \n Introduction to the Text \n Written by Fernão Lopes (1380-90?-1460), the first Royal Chronicler of the kingdom of Portugal, the Crônica de D. Pedro I ( Chronicle of Peter I ) was probably composed in the first half of the fifteenth century. It belongs to the earlier tradition of late medieval royal chronicles (c. 13th and 14th centuries), histories that narrated important events in the lives of kings, aristocrats, and kingdoms. Common in France, Portugal, Castile, and Aragon, such histories often combined a very positive account of the king’s life—as a means of simultaneously praising him and recording his actions—with the intent of presenting lessons on how to rule a kingdom, drawn from the king’s achievements and mistakes.  The events described in the Chronicle of Peter I took place between the years 1357 and 1367. Those years were important for the Portuguese kingdom, because they preceded a change in its ruling family in 1383-1385, when the family of Avis replaced Peter I’s family, the kings of Bourgogne. The first king of the Avis family, John I, was Peter I of Bourgogne’s illegitimate son. In a way, writing the history of Peter I’s reign of Portugal meant narrating the beginnings of John I’s ascension to the Portuguese crown.  It was under John I, in 1418, that Fernão Lopes was appointed the Royal Keeper of the Archives ( Guarda-Mor ). Lopes was responsible for keeping the official records of the kingdom of Portugal, such as royal decrees and treaties. After holding that position for 26 years, Lopes was appointed as the first Royal Chronicler ( Cronista-Mor ) in 1434, by king Edward I, John I’s son. Lopes was then assigned the task of writing the official history of the kings of Portugal, in addition to his role as the Royal Keeper. It was probably after he was appointed as the Royal Chronicler that Lopes started writing the Chronicle of Peter I . In the prologue presented here, we see how Lopes’s two positions influenced his writing. He attempts to balance a faithful record of past events, as expected from a royal archivist, with trustworthy praise of Peter I, as expected from the royal chronicler.  This double role partly explains why the Chronicle of Peter I is unique among late medieval chronicles. First, Lopes’s interest in historical accuracy distinguishes his work. He explained his vision of historical writing in the prologue to another work, the Crônica Del Rey D. João I ( Chronicle of King John I ). There he claimed that past chronicles often showed too much “affectionate bias” ( mundanall afeiçom ) in favor of the king, which ended up obscuring the truth about the events.  A second distinctive feature of Lopes’s  Chronicle is how he focuses on people other than the king. Late medieval chronicles tended to concentrate mostly on the person of the king and those closest to him, his aristocracy. As this prologue illustrates, however, the chronicle’s main subject is not Peter I’s person, but his importance for both the laws of the kingdom and the life of its people. The Chronicle of Peter I is made up of a prologue and 46 chapters. The prologue presents Lopes’s interpretation of Peter I’s reign, while the chapters focus on specific events, covering topics such as internal policy (justice, monetary policy), Portuguese maritime exploration, the relationships with the kingdoms of Castile and England, Portugal’s involvement in the fight against the Muslim kingdoms, Peter’s forbidden love affair with Inês de Castro, and others.  The Chronicle of Peter I was well received in late medieval Portugal. It helped other chroniclers frame the kingdom’s official history, emphasizing how the life of the king and the life of the kingdom were inseparable. After Lopes’s  Chronicle of Peter I , telling readers how they should interpret the facts narrated in a chronicle became as important as getting the facts right. What Lopes achieves in the prologue of the Chronicle of Peter I —namely an innovative way of relating events in the king’s life to wh..."

Marston MS 22 is written on parchment in a large gothic bookhand with three discernible hands (ff. 1r, 2r-91r, 93r-115v, respectively). The added childbirth prayer is copied in an Anglicana script. Based on its script and its decoration, Marston MS 22 was probably produced in England around 1250 CE. The added childbirth prayer was added later, possibly around 1400, when Marston MS 22 was rebound. \n Introduction to the Text \n Childbirth in medieval Europe was often the most dangerous experience of a woman's life. Because of poor hygiene and a lack of gynecological knowledge, scholars have estimated that as many as ten percent of women died during childbirth or immediately afterwards. Not only did mothers die in large numbers, but as many as thirty percent of children died in the process of childbirth. In the face of these dangers, medieval people used a wide variety of charms and prayers in an attempt to improve their chances of a successful delivery.  The Marston Childbirth Prayer is a late 14th-century childbirth prayer from England, written in Latin. This prayer provides rare insight into the life of a medieval woman, speaking directly to one of the most intimate and dangerous experiences of her life.  The prayer draws primarily on three stories from the Christian Bible: the creation of the world, the conception of Isaac, and the conception and birth of Christ. The first part of the prayer focuses on God's generative power: the creation of land and sea, plants and animals, and Adam and Eve. The next part recalls the birth of Isaac, focusing on the miraculous fertility of Abraham and Sarah despite their advanced ages. The prayer then turns to the conception and..."

The dedicatory poem tells us that it was made for the emperor Basil II (r. 976-1025), possibly early in his reign. Made in the waning years of the Macedonian dynasty, which was known for producing encyclopedic collections on various topics, the manuscript is a collection of illustrated saints’ lives arranged according to the church calendar. The Menologion contains entries for September through February. The consistent layout of each page comprises a title naming the saint to be commemorated and the day, an image of the saint, and brief account of their life. Befitting its imperial recipient, the richly detailed miniatures of the manuscript are all on golden ground (meaning that gold leaf has been applied to the page). They are also important as one of the few instances of medieval art where we know the artist’s name. Each miniature is accompanied by the name of one of eight artists, presumably the person who painted it.  Contrary to its name, the book is more properly a synaxarion. Both synaxaria and menologia collect and list saints according to their celebration in the church calendar, but menologia generally have longer lives and often include prayers or other relevant texts for the celebration of each saint. Synaxaria contain much shorter notices, varying from a simple line of remembrance up to the paragraph length of this manuscript.  This particular entry, which is found on page 134 of the manuscript , tells the story of the patriarch Ignatios who is commemorated on October 23 in the Menologion and in the present-day Eastern Orthodox and Roman churches. Ignatios, who also has his own full-length vita , was the son of the emperor Michael I (r. 811-13) and was castrated when his father abdic..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Millstatt Plaint of Sin is transmitted in full in Klagenfurt Landesarchiv Cod. GV 6/19, a major anthology of ‘Early Middle High German’ verse texts. It was made around 1200, or slightly later, in Bavaria or Austria, and contains the Old German Genesis , Exodus , and Physiologus , accompanied by illustrations, followed by five short religious poems, of which the Millstatt Plaint of Sin is the third. We do not know for whom it was made – perhaps for nobility or for a female religious community. The part of the manuscript containing our poem is heavily damaged and so the poem itself is often difficult to reconstruct. Some insight into the missing sections is however offered by two other manuscript witnesses that contain fragmented versions of the same poem: 1) Munich BSB Cgm 5249/60a, four parchment fragments of Honorius’ Elucidarium from the late twelfth century, with a German text written below in a smaller hand (although perhaps the same hand) that correlates – albeit with considerably deviation – to around 100 lines of the Millstatt Plaint of Sin ; 2) Zurich Zentralbibliothek Cod. Rh. 77, a ninth- or tenth-century Latin manuscript with various twelfth-century additions, including a fragment of a German poem often known as the Rheinau Paul . This poem correlates fairly closely to parts of the end of the Millstatt Plaint of Sin , although it is by no means identical. \n Introduction to the Text \n The Millstatt Plaint of Sin , written in middle of the twelfth century perhaps in the South West of Germany, is a substantial poem addressed to God in the voice of a sinner. The poem is conventionally counted as part of a small sub-genre of Early Middle High German religious poetry known as the ‘Sündenklage’, or ‘plaint of sin’. These poems – there is also the Vorau Plaint of Sin  and the more simplistic Uppsala Plaint of Sin – all have at their heart a confession of sinfulness and a prayer to God for mercy, and are thought to have taken their inspiration from the more pragmatic text-type of the German confession ( Beichte ). These confessions, generalized first-person confessions in prose, are transmitted widely from the ninth century and had a variety of liturgical and devotional functions.  The manuscript of the Millstatt Plaint of Sin is heavily damaged, but it is nonetheless possible to get a good sense of the poem and its themes. It is not simply a confession of sins, but rather offers a conceptualization of the world, as well as the place of man and his sins within it. By framing the confessional act with sections praising God and his creation and structuring sins around the inappropriate use of individual body parts, the Millstatt Plaint of Sin explains that God is in everything and that all created things are a way of seeing God; hence sinning is perceived as an almost illogical malfunctioning of creation. Although ostensibly quite straightforward, the poem tackles – in a rewarding and indeed quite challenging way – a number of contemporary issues that will be of interest to readers: the relationship between body and soul; bodily fragmentation; and the nature and construction of selfhood. \n Credits \n"

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The text used for this translation is from a 14th or 15th century manuscript, Festal Menaion , in the St. Sofia Collection of the National Library of Russia, St. Petersburg (Софийское собрание 396, fol. 1v-4v). A digitization of the manuscript is available to view online here: http://nlr.ru/manuscripts/RA1527/elektronnyiy-katalog?ab=D684C217-677F-40DD-AADA-33FD3A80D9B1 . The Festal Menaion is a liturgical book of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which contains texts used for the most important feasts that always fall on the same dates of the ecclesiastical year. The Festal Menaion is an abridged version of the Menaion , a far more extensive liturgical book which holds texts for the services for all the saints’ feasts and commemorations that have a constant date in the liturgical calendar. The legend about the miracle of the icon of the Mother of God is included in this Festal Menaion because it celebrates the feast of the icon of the Mother of God, a significant religious holiday in Novgorod. As in most liturgical manuscripts, the names of the authors and scribes are unknown. However, from the differing handwriting and orthographic conventions used in the text, it is evident that more than one scribe worked on recording or copying this tale. \n Introduction to the Text \n This legend about a miracle brought about by an icon of the Mother of God refers to the events of the 1169 CE battle between Novgorod and Suzdal, two kingdoms in what is now western Russia. Written accounts of the event from both sides appeared soon after the battle, and an oral legend emerged to explain Novgorod’s victory. The tale in this edition dates to the 14th or 15th century, and describes divine intervention in the conflict between Novgorod and Suzdal.  According to the text, the conflict between Novgorod and Suzdal began with a tax dispute, as a province under Novgorod’s influence chose to pay tribute to Suzdal instead of Novgorod. In response, the Novgorodians sent a tax collector to the province along with an army. This army was intercepted by the Suzdalians, resulting in a battle with heavy losses on the side of Suzdal. Following this battle, tensions escalated between the two kingdoms, and Prince Andrei of Suzdal sent his full military might to attack Novgorod. While Novgorod was under siege, the archbishop, St. John, had a vision telling him to take the icon of the Mother of God (a painted image of the Virgin Mary praying with baby Jesus in a circle in her chest) from its place in the Church of the Holy Savior on Il’ina Street and place it opposite the enemy. The following day, he held a holy gathering and told the people of Novgorod to follow its instructions. However, the icon would not move from its place until he prayed beneath it, and then it moved on its own, a miracle which all the congregation witnessed. They brought the icon out facing the enemy, and the icon “cried,” tears appearing to flow down its face, as the Mother of God prayed to save the city of Novgorod. The Suzdalian army then descended into chaos, fighting amongst themselves. The Novgorodians were able to kill the majority and capture the rest thanks to divine intervention. Afterwards, the date of the victory was made a feast day and all the people of Novgorod celebrated.  Starting in medieval times, this tale was commemorated as a holy event later incorporated into the body of religious texts of the Russian Orthodox Church, establishing the titular icon of the Mother of God as a holy object. This icon, known as The Mother of God of the Sign , remains one of the most significant icons in the Russian Orthodox Church, and has stood for Novgorodian strength and independence throughout history.  In medieval as well as modern Russian Orthodoxy, the use of religious images such as the icon of the Mother of God is an important part of church practice and popular devotion. They are used as objects of worship, but are also associated with the spiritual powers of the personages and theological concepts they depict, and thus the subject of many superstitions. The icon of The Mother of God of the Sign , a central participant in this legend, is one such icon. Through “crying,” it established itself as being spiritually more than just dry wood, and showed Novgorod the favor of the Mother of God herself. Another visual icon, The Miracle of the Mother of God of the Sign , was created in the 15th century to depict the events of this legend. On the feast day dedicated to this legendary victory, the visual icon is worshipped at the same time as the legend is read. \n Further Reading \n Birnbaum, Henrik.

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The first cycle of legends regarding the Vladimir Mother of God icon was composed between 1163 and the late 1180s. According to scholars, these dates are indicated in a note in a later version of the legends, written in a menology— an ecclesiastical calendar containing biographies of Saints— by the Miliutin brothers in the 17th century. The first historical work that linked disparate legends regarding the miracles performed by the Mother of God into one cohesive narrative is the Book of Royal Degrees compiled in the circle of the Metropolitan Makarii of Moscow in the 1550s and 1560s. However, many earlier sources mention the icon’s history and the miracles caused by the icon’s direct intervention. For example, the Laurentian Chronicle compiled in the late 14th century tells of how the Mother of God icon was delivered from Constantinople to Kiev, while the 15th-century Ermonlin Chronicle describes the Virgin’s intercession in the battle against Tamerlane in 1395. The edition of the text of the Legend  used for this translation comes from a late 15th-century manuscript, #637 from the Egorov Collection at the Russian State Library in Moscow (Collection 98). Egor Egorovich Egorov (1862–1917) was a Moscow merchant born into a family of Old Believers (a group of Eastern Orthodox Christians who maintain the practices of the Russian Orthodox Church as they were before the reforms of 1652 – 1666) who collected medieval manuscripts and art. \n Introduction to the Text \n The Legend of the Miracles of the Vladimir Mother of God Icon  is a 15th-century text relating a series of ten miracles performed by the Vladimir Mother of God icon in the late 12th century. Widely regarded as one of the most sacred icons in Russian history, the Vladimir Mother of God, painted with tempera on wood in the 12th century, depicts the Virgin Mary embracing Christ the child cheek to cheek. Dressed in gold, Christ gazes up at his mother adoringly. This tender pose is emblematic of a genre of icons called an “Icon of Loving Tenderness,”— or umilenie in Russian — and is meant to remind the viewer of the love uniting Mary and Christ.  The Vladimir Mother of God Icon was brought to Kiev from Byzantium in 1131-32 and remained there until 1155, when Prince Andrei Bogoliubsky decided to move the icon to his new capital city of Vladimir in the Rostov-Suzdal principality in northeastern Rus (approximately 120 miles northeast of Moscow). Prince Andrei honored the icon by decorating it with a silver riza — a metal covering meant to protect icons from damage— bejeweled with precious metals and stones. He then built the Dormition Cathedral in 1158 in the icon’s honor and placed it inside, where the icon served thereafter as the symbolic religious protector and benefactor of Vladimir.  It is likely that Prince Andrei himself was involved in creating the initial cycle of legends in order to legitimize Vladimir as the new political and spiritual capital of Rus. This is especially plausible considering that Andrei is a witness to many of the miracles described in the Legend , one of which includes details about the birth of his own child. The Legend begins by comparing the Mother of God icon to the sun, stating that both have the ability to traverse and warm the entire universe, a message that suggests Prince Andrei’s ambitions to unite several principalities of northern Rus under his rule. This underlying political agenda is prevalent in the geographical scope of the Legend , which suggests Prince Andrei’s spreading glory since the miracles do not only occur in Prince Andrei’s capital city of Vladimir and its surrounding environs, but also in more distant cities such as Murom, Tver, and Pereiaslavl.  In many 16th-century manuscripts, the miracles are preceded by the Legend of the Victory over the Volga Bulgars  of 1164, the story of how Prince Andrei defeated the Volga Bulgars with the help of a miracle by the Mother of God icon, which Andrei carried throughout the campaign in the vanguard of the army. In contrast, the Legend of the Vladimir Mother of God Icon  depicts the everyday realities of 12th-century Rus, using colloquial language and expressive dialogue. These are not miracles relating military victories, but instead empathetic vignettes of women suffering from complicated pregnancies, a teenage boy with a mysterious eye disease, and people grappling with blindness and heart disease. In each case, the intervention of the Mother of God icon cures the afflicted, bringing peace and stability to the people of Vladimir and beyond.  The Vladimir Mother of God icon continued to serve as a symbol of Russian imperial and national destiny throughout Russia’s history. The Ermolin Chronicle of the 1470s attributes the Grand Prince Vasily I’s victory over the Mongol ruler Tamerlane in 1395 to the icon’s intervention. The Romanovs kept the icon in the Kremlin as a symbol of Russia’s link to the historical center of Christianity in ..."

    "title": "Muspilli | Muspilli\n",
    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Muspilli is an incomplete verse narrative (103 lines) written in Old High German. The manuscript containing the poem, which was produced in Bavaria (southern Germany) in the 9th century CE, contains neither the beginning nor the end of the poem. The reason for its incompleteness is probably due to its having been written in the margins of another text: a Latin theological work composed by Adalram (d. 836), bishop of Salzburg, for the young Louis the German (ca. 810–876). It appears Muspilli was added to the manuscript later by a different scribe, but little can be deduced about who produced the text or why. It is conjectured that the beginning and end have been lost because they would have been written on the outermost pages of the manuscript, which often incur the most damage over time. One of the most debated questions about Muspilli is its name. The original manuscript does not include a title, and the name Muspilli was assigned by the poem's first editor, Johann Andreas Schmeller. The name comes from the Old High German word muspille , meaning the destruction of the world by fire, which occurs in line 57 of the poem. This is the only known occurrence of this word. Scholars have since tried to give it various names which better suit the purpose of the poem, but none of these has stuck.  Muspilli mainly deals with two main ideas: the fate of human souls after death and the Final Judgement. The first part of the poem describes how two groups of angels will fight over one soul to see whether it belongs in Heaven or Hell. The second part of the poem provides two narratives: Elijah and the Antichrist fight each other, the former as the champion of God and the latter as the champion of the Devil. In this duel, the Antichrist will be defeated and Elijah will be wounded and his blood will burn the whole world. Then the text describes how, in the Final Judgement, angels and demons will testify to the actions of humans on earth, and those actions will be scrutinized. At the end of the poem, the Holy Cross is brought forth and Christ reveals the wounds that he suffered for the sake of humankind.  One of the most discussed aspects of this poem are its sources. Although explicitly Christian elements are abundant, scholars have argued that Muspilli is deeply infused with pre-Christian culture and draws much of its material from Norse mythology. Although the names mentioned in the poem are all Christian figures, some scholars argue that they are essentially the Christian representation of Norse gods.  Muspilli is considered to be one of the most significant pieces of Old High German literature because of its vivid depiction of Christian themes in the vernacular language. Through this poem, modern readers can gain a better insight into the spiritual life and broader culture of ninth-century Germans. \n Further Reading \n Murdoch, Brian. “The Carolingian Period and the Early Middle Ages (750–1100).” The Cambridge History of German Literature , edited by Helen Watanabe-O'Kelly.

Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome, wrote this book of pastoral care for the benefit of bishops because Pelagius, his mentor and head of the Roman church, ut post se episcopi locum tenuisset. asked that he take the place of bishop after him. et in gallia lugdunensi conscripsit huius libri incepta. And in Lyonnais Gaul he composed the beginnings of this book et in gallia belgica consummata est id est in ciuitate que dicitur brigalis and in Belgian Gaul it was completed, that is, in the city that is called Bruges, quia gregorius principatum uitare uolens in occidentales plagas gallorum fugerat. because Gregory, wanting to avoid leadership, had fled to the western regions of Gaul. et alii putant quia imperatoris de gothis vel insani regis romanorum tempore hic liber conscriptus est in quo narrat gregorius opus esse difficile principatum æcclesię; And others think that this book, in which Gregory recounts that leadership of the Church is difficult work, was begun at the time of the emperor of the Goths or of the demented leader of the Romans. Sanctus gregorius. annis. xiii. et. mensibus. x. et diebus. ix. rexit æcclesiam; St. Gregory ruled the Church for thirteen years and ten months and nine days. Gregorius grece uigil latine. “Gregorius” in Greek means vigil [“alert”] in Latin, et a uerbo gregorio. iii. coniugationes. quia inuenitur gregorite id est uigilate. and from the word “Gregorius” come three etymological connections because “gregorite” – that is, vigilate [“you (pl.) watch”] – is found. \n Introduction to the Source \n To the best of my knowledge, this text has not been previously edited or translated. I have found it in two English manuscripts that were produced centuries apart and that bear no direct relation to one another: Oxford, St. John’s College, MS 28 (s. x med. and x 3/4 or x/xi; the Pastoral Care is in the slightly later part), fol. 6v and Oxford, Merton College, MS 16, (s. xiv ex., xv 1 ), fol. 139va. The text must certainly exist in more manuscript witnesses of the Pastoral Care , from a range of times and—one assumes, given the text’s continental origin—of places. \n Introduction to the Text \n This short preface to Pope Gregory the Great’s Regula Pastoralis ( Pastoral Rule or Pastoral Care ) offers an unusual account of the genesis of that text, composed—so the preface says—during travel that Gregory undertook through Gaul in an attempt to avoid becoming pope. By contrast, the standard narrative of the Pastoral Care ’s origin sees it completed presumably in Rome, not long after Gregory’s papal inauguration, and sent off thence to John, bishop of Ravenna. (History supports the second version of events: Gregory was first in Constantinople, then Rome, prior to assuming the papacy.) Gregory’s initial reluctance to become pope is a constant in both origin stories, however, even if he is more active in his escapism in the preface presented here. The tally noted in the preface extends Gregory’s time in office by four months. He was pope from September 3, 590 to March 12, 604: thirteen years, six months (not ten months), and nine days. The etymology of Gregory’s name is sound.  The preface also alludes to a second alternate history of the Pastoral Care , one that is introduced in a more displaced way: “And others think that…” This origin story is vague with its mentions of an “emperor of the Goths” and a “demented leader of the Romans,” but these could be references to Justin II, Emperor of the Byzantine Empire (r. 565-74), and Leovigild, the Visigothic king with whom he contended. (Justin II notably suffered from mental illness.) This would place the text’s purported composition sometime between 565 and 574; for context, Gregory entered monastic life in 574. \n Further Reading \n Godden, Malcolm. “Prologues and Epilogues in the Old English Pastoral Care, and Their Carolingian Models.” Journal of English and Germanic Philology , vol. 110, no. 4, 2011, pp. 441-73.

    "textauthor": "Ouyang Xiu 歐陽修",
    "body": " 臨江仙 To the tune “Immortal by The River” 柳外輕雷池上雨， Beyond the willows there is light thunder, over the pond it rains. 雨聲滴碎荷聲。 The tinkle of the rain shatters the sound of lotus leaves. 小樓西角斷虹明。 At the western corner of the building, a rainbow appears. 欄干倚處， Leaning against the railings, 待得月華生。 I wait for the moonlight to emerge. 燕子飛來窺畫棟， Swallows fly by, peeking from the painted rafter. 玉鈎垂下簾旌。 I let down the curtain from the jade hooks. 凉波不動簟紋平。 The cool waves no longer move, the bamboo mat is still. 水精雙枕， Beside a pair of crystal pillows, 傍有墮釵橫。 a fallen hairpin lies. \n Introduction to the Text \n This song lyric was allegedly composed in the following context: when Ouyang Xiu was a junior governor at Henan (a province in China), he had a romantic relationship with a local singer. At that time, Qian Weiyan was the lead governor of Henan. One day when Qian was hosting a party in his garden, Ouyang Xiu and the singer were late. Qian asked them the reason for their delay. The singer answered: “The weather is too hot, and I had heatstroke. I was sleeping in a cool room and lost my golden hairpin.” When Qian heard these words, he laughed and said to the singer: “If Ouyang Xiu can write a ci about this, I will give you the money for your lost hairpin.” Ouyang Xiu then wrote the following lyric, and Qian, satisfied, gave the singer money for her hairpin. The not-so-subtle cleverness of this lyric is that it describes the couple making love (in the second stanza), once they go inside and lower the curtain. So this is an alternate explanation of why the couple was late to the party, the suggestive indirectness of which would have amused everyone who heard the singer perform it.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as “song lyrics.” This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, “graceful”) and háofàng (豪放, “bold”). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Ouyang Xiu was a highly influential politician, scholar, and historian of the Northern Song dynasty. He was revered as a grand master of literature and philosophy, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he laid the foundation for the literati mentality of the dynasty. When Ouyang was four years old, the death of his father, a fifty-seven-year-old military officer, left the family destitute. Poverty did not stop Ouyang’s passion for reading: he would borrow books from his neighbors and make copies in order to study them further.

    "body": " 浪淘沙 To the tune “Waves Scour the Sand” 把酒祝東風。 I hold up the wine and toast the eastern wind, 且共從容。 “Let us dally and not rush.” 垂楊紫陌洛城東。 Along the lilac-laden path with drooping willows in the east of Luoyang, 總是當時攜手處， Is where we used to walk hand in hand, 游遍芳叢。 Roaming among the thickets of fragrance.Fragrance refers to flowers 聚散苦匆匆。 Gathering together is always fleeting and separating is always bitter. 此恨無窮。 My regrets about this have no end. 今年花勝去年紅。 The flowers this year are redder than the last; 可惜明年花更好， It is a pity that when next year’s ones are even better, 知與誰同。 I do not know with whom I will look at them. \n Introduction to the Text \n Ouyang Xiu composed this song lyric when he and his friends revisited their old haunts in the northern suburbs of Luoyang during springtime. The time frame depicted spans the previous year, the current year and the year ahead. The lyrics convey sadness about the inconstancy of life and the inevitable passing of time.   The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as “song lyrics.” This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, “graceful”) and háofàng (豪放, “bold”). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Ouyang Xiu was a highly influential politician, scholar, and historian of the Northern Song dynasty. He was revered as a grand master of literature and philosophy, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he laid the foundation for the literati mentality of the dynasty. When Ouyang was four years old, the death of his father, a fifty-seven-year-old military officer, left the family destitute. Poverty did not stop Ouyang’s passion for reading: he would borrow books from his neighbors and make copies in order to study them further. Later, he became a bureaucrat and was posted to many cities as a prefect of the imperial court. In his political life, he was principled and solemn, and wrote a great deal in many genres.

It can be read in Elinando’s writings E avendo egli accesa la fossa de’ carboni una volta, e sendo la notte in una sua capannetta a guardia della incesa fossa, sentì in su l’ora della mezzanotte grandi strida. And once, when he had lit the charcoal pit and was spending the night in a small hut guarding the burning pit, around midnight he heard some loud wailing. Usci fuori per vedere che fosse, e vide venire in verso la fossa, correndo e stridendo, una femmina iscapigliata e ignuda; e dietro le venta umo cavaliere in su uno cavallo nero correndo, con uno coltello ignudo in mano; e della bocca e degli occhi e del naso del cavaliere e del cavallo uscia fiamma di fuoco ardente. He went out to see what it was and he saw, coming towards the pit, running and wailing, a woman disheveled and naked; and behind her, with a naked dagger in his hand, came a knight riding a black horse; and from the mouth, eyes, and nose of the knight and the horse came a flame of blazing fire. Giugnendo la femmina alla fossa, ch’ardea, non passò più oltre, e nella fossa non ardiva di gittarsi; ma correndo intorno alla fossa, fu so praggiunta dalcavaliere, che dietro le correa; la quale traendo guai, presa per li svolazzanti o capelli, crudelmente la feri per lo mezzo del petto col coltello che tenea in mano. Once the woman reached the burning pit, she couldn’t cross it, and she didn’t have the courage to throw herself into the pit; but, running around the pit, she was overtaken by the knight, who was chasing her; he grabbed her by her windswept hair, and while she was wailing, he fiercely wounded her in the center of her chest with the dagger he was holding in his hand. E cadendo in terra, con molto ispargimento di sangue, si la riprese per li insanguinati capelli, e gittòlla nella fossa de’carboni ardenti; dove lasciandola stare per alcuno spazio di tempo, tutta focosa e arsa la ritolse; e ponéndolasi davanti in sul collo del cavallo, correndo se n’andò per la via dond’era venuto. As she fell to the ground, splattering blood everywhere, he grabbed her again by her now bloodied hair and he threw her into the pit of burning charcoal. He left her there for a little while, taking her out once she was smoldering and burnt. Finally, he placed her in front of himself across his horse’s back and he galloped away in the direction from which he had come. La seconda e la terza notte vide il carbonaio la simile visione. On the second and third night the charcoal-burner saw the same vision. Donde, essendo egli dimestico del conte di Niversa, tra per l’arte sua de’ carboni, e per la bontà la quale il conte, ch’era uomo d’anima, gradiva, venne al conte, e dissegli la visione che tre notti avea veduta. And, since he was acquainted with the Count of Nevers, both because of his charcoal-craft and because of his kindness, which the count - a religious man - appreciated, he went to the count and told him about the vision that he had seen for three nights. Venne il conte col carbonaio al luogo della fossa; e vegghiando insieme nella capannetta, nell’ora usata venne la femmina stridendo, e 'l cavaliere dietro, e feciono tutto ciò che 'l carbonaio avea veduto. Il conte, avvegna che per lo orribile fatto ch’avea veduto, fosse molto spaventato, prese ardire. The count went with the charcoal-burner to the place where the pit was. While they were keeping watch together in the hut, at the usual hour, the woman came wailing, with the knight following her, and they did everything that the charcoal-burner had seen them do. E partendosi il cavaliere ispietato colla donna arsa attraversata in su 'l nero cavallo, gridò iscongiurandolo che dovesse ristare, e sporre la mostrata visione. The count took courage, even though he was terrified by the horrible event that he had seen. As the merciless knight was leaving with the burnt woman lying on the black horse, the count shouted, begging him to stay and to explain the vision that had been shown.

Aug.] Here begins the passion of the holy virgins Hope, Faith, Charity, and their mother Wisdom (Kalends Mulier quedam nomine Sapientia de genere primo ualde diues, Romam aduenit cum filiabus suis. A certain woman by the name of Wisdom, who was very wealthy and of a most noble family, came to Rome with her daughters. Hae decorissime nimium fuerunt. They were exceedingly beautiful. Et cum ibi essent, cucurrerunt accipere signum Domini nostri et saluatoris Iesu Christi. When they had arrived, they ran to receive the sign of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, Erudite enim a matre fuerunt iam pridem, ut Christianitatis nomen firmiter tenerent. for they had already been taught by their mother in such a way that they held on firmly to the name of Christianity. Quae instructae a matre sanctis monitis, et Christi edocte eloquiis, proficiebant et crescebant cotidie in Dei timore. Indeed, instructed by their mother in sacred counsels and educated through the sayings of Christ, they advanced and grew each day in their fear of God. Gaudebat quoque mater earum et exultabat in Domino: orans semper Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum, ut ampliorem fidem et tolerantiam daret paruulis eius, et in multa uirtute tolerantie proficerent. Their mother also rejoiced and exulted in the Lord: she constantly prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ that he would give her little ones greater faith and endurance, as well as that they themselves would make great progress in the virtue of endurance. Rudem enim agebant aetatem, prophetarum quoque uerba in corde semper tractantes, et Deo psallentes erant. Although they were young, they always turned over the words of the prophets in their hearts and sang psalms to God. Euntibus uero illis ad aecclesiam suam, haec in corde suo cogitabant, ut pro Domino paterentur. They thought about these things as they went to church, so that they could open themselves to the Lord. Et dum frequenter ad aecclesiam orandi causa irent, quidam maligno spiritu incitatus, uenit ad imperatorem et dixit ei, “Mulier quaedam cum tribus puellis nescio unde huc aduenit, et nostris matronis persuasit, ut colerent unum Deum et filium eius Iesum Christum, et fraudauit nos a matrimoniali coniugio. While they often went to church to pray, someone incited by an evil spirit went to the emperor and said to him, “There is a certain woman with three daughters. I don’t know from where she has come to this place, but she has persuaded our married women to worship one God and his son Jesus Christ and has thus cheated us out of our marital rights Nam ad cibum atque ad potum, iam nolunt, cum conuenire paeniter nolunt.” For now our wives take interest in neither food nor water, and completely reject intercourse.” Audiens haec Adrianus, mox praetores misit qui eas exhiberent. Hearing these words, Hadrian immediately sent praetors to summon them. Ibant Dei uirgines, cum matre sua gaudentes. Ut autem appropinquarent ad palatium regis, signauerunt se signaculo Christi. The virgins of God came along rejoicing with their mother, and when they approached the palace of the emperor, they crossed themselves with the sign of Christ, Erat uero gratia Christi, confirmans eas. whose grace was indeed present and gave them strength. Intrantibus itaque eis in palatium, Adrianus intuebatur eas, et uidens earum facies gloriosas, obstupuit proper excellentem gloriam Dei, quibus respondere non potuit. Therefore, as they entered into the palace, Hadrian watched them and saw their faces, which were full of glory. He was struck dumb by the extraordinary glory of God and had no response for them. Post paululum autem uocans matrem uirginum, interrogauit eam dicens, “Cuius dignatatis es, uel quae circa te sunt? However, after a short time he called the mother of the virgins and questioned her, saying, “What is your rank, and who are these girls around you? Ex corde enim fecistis haec in Romanorum ciuitate dominatores deos negantes, qui uniuersam urbem fabricauerunt; nomen uero tuum qui uocetur expone.” For you have all intentionally committed these deeds, denying the gods in the city of the Romans, although they have made the whole city. Well, tell us the name by which you are called.” Quae dixit, “Christiana.” She said, “Christian.” Adrianus imperator dixit, “Interrogo nomen commune secundum homines.” The emperor Hadrian said, “I am asking for your common name as is customary among men.” Illa respondit, “Primum quidem ineffabili nomine Christiana sum; a parentibus uero nomen quod accepi, dicor Sapientia; de genere primo quod eminenti existens Italie. She responded, “I am indeed first and foremost known by that unutterable name of ‘Christian’, but as for the name which I received from my parents, I am called Wisdom, and des..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The first edition of A Brief Treatise of Doctrine was published in 1560 in Geneva by Jean Crespin, a printer with known Calvinist leanings. Along with the other works of Perez, this text was banned in Spain and would only have circulated through clandestine networks of Reformation sympathizers. By 1560, those networks were collapsing as more arrests were made in Spain by the Inquisition. Consequently, it is improbable that this text had a wide circulation. It likely would have disappeared were it not for the dedicated efforts of Luis de Usoz y Rio and his partner Benjamin B. Wiffen to collect and preserve reformist texts in the 19th Century. The two men worked cross-continentally to find rare books in small bookstores around the world. They re-bound and re-printed the works they found in the Reformistas Antiguos Españoles (Old Spanish Reformers) , the oldest editions of which are held today in the National Library of Spain. \n Introduction to the Text \n This Prologue to A Brief Treatise of Doctrine (1560) is attributed to Dr. Juan Perez de Piñeda—a Spanish scholar, theologian, priest, and condemned heretic. Perez published in Spanish while in exile in Francophone nations, collaborated with Jean Calvin, read Lutheran texts, and was in communication with other Spanish Reformers through clandestine networks. A Brief Treatise of Doctrine is representative of these intercultural and interdenominational influences in Perez’s own thought, and consequently resists established dichotomies between Spain and Europe, Catholicism and Protestantism, Calvinism and Lutheranism.  Scholarship on Perez’s life and works is archetypical of scholarship on the Spanish Reformers in general. Catholic critic Marcelino Menedez y Pelayo aptly described the state of the field with the biblical appropriation: “the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few” ( “Historia de Los Heterodoxos Españoles, v.1.” 18 ). Extensive bibliographic work on the Spanish Reformation has preserved and organized a plethora of primary sources pertenint to the field. Consequently, the few modern scholars who have worked on the Spanish Reformation have approached it in broad terms, producing long histories and general studies. While a handful of anglophone scholars have begun studying the reformers individually, much work remains. As such, A Brief Treatise of Doctrine is the perfect text to introduce into Anglophone consideration of the Spanish Reformation. With increased access to Perez’s writings, interdisciplinary studies on Perez can shed new light on the intricate web of theological developments sprawling onto the international stage of 16th-century Europe. \n Further Reading \n Boehmer, Edward, editor.

    "title": "Concerning the Wicked Woman | De Muliere Mala\n",
    "textauthor": "Petrus Pictor",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The De Muliere Mala was first compiled in the Liber Floridus , an 1120 encyclopedia containing what Lambert, a later canon of Saint Omer, considered to be the most important knowledge in his possession. The “autograph copy,” written in Lambert’s own hand, is currently stored in the Ghent University Library as MS 92. The manuscript includes other Pictor poems, for example a satire on money narrated by the personified Denarius (“Dollar”). The fact that Pictor’s work was deliberately excerpted for inclusion in this collection, alongside more well-known texts such as Isidore’s Etymologiae , indicates that contemporaries appreciated its literary and moral value. While there are no exact duplicates, dozens of partial copies survive, including the twelfth-century French manuscript upon which this edition is based. Their proliferation suggests that Petrus Pictor, and by extension the De Muliere Mala , were frequently read in medieval European monasteries. \n Introduction to the Text \n Petrus Pictor, a canon (resident clergyman) at Saint-Omer in northern France, composed De Muliere Mala (“The Wicked Woman”) in the late eleventh or early twelfth century. In his poem, Pictor first cites a litany of historical and biblical examples on the evil of womankind before detailing the fatal vengeance of a rebuffed mother-seducer who falsely accuses her own son of rape. De Muliere Mala thus participates in a long tradition of misogynistic Christian writing as embodied by Tertullian, a pioneering theologian from the second and third centuries AD, who interpreted Eve’s fall from grace as a warning that women are “the Devil’s gateway” ( De Habitu Mulierum 1.1). Nevertheless, it is far more than a mere moralising text, for its explicit treatment of incestuous lust looks to Classical models: Pictor accords a literary status to his verses by referencing ancient erotic writers such as Ovid (43BC-17/18AD) and Apuleius (c. 124-170 AD). The rhetoric of the poem is reinforced by its aggressive anaphoras (repeated phrases at the beginnings of certain lines) and pounding polysyndetons (lists of words linked only by conjunctions, typically “and...and”), which simultaneously drive home the notion that all women are malicious and evoke the eponymous Wicked Woman’s uncontrollable frenzy. Owing to these complex layers, this rarely-studied poem has the potential to please a diverse crowd. It is especially interesting to consider its portrayal of sexual aggression in the light of current debates on this topic, and to question its support of gender essentialism, that is, the notion that all women share the same malevolent characteristics. The poem is, moreover, an enjoyable read as it constitutes a thrilling psychological portrait on the extremities to which lust and pride can lead. \n Further Reading \n Carver, Robert H.

Sister Agnes Waller Hec adhuc in secula maritata magnique feruoris ac deuocionis ad Deum fuit, elemosinis ceterisque deuote insistens operibus pietatis. While she was still in the world, she was betrothed to God and full of great fervor and devotion towards him, faithfully applying herself in almsgiving and in other works of piety. Que cum rebus et diuiciis competenter habundaret, incidit aliquando, Deo permittente, in manus quorumdam nobilium et potentum, qui eam in bonis suis plurimum molestabant, inferentes ei dampnum nimis graue. Since she was reasonably wealthy in property and riches, she sometimes fell, God allowing, into the hands of certain noble and powerful men, who troubled her most frequently regarding her goods, inflicting a very great financial loss on her. Uerum hiis ita gestis, tempus non multo post instabat, quo percipere debuit altaris uiuifica sacramenta. Not long after these things had happened, the time approached in which she was bound to receive the life-giving sacrament of the altar. Itaque interrogata a confessore suo utrum prius ex corde remitteret hiis qui se leserant, ed dicente eo quoniam aliter dare sibi minime presumeret sacrosanctum corpus Christi, tunc illa repente cum multa animi libertate respondens ait: “Si omnia mundi huius regna dicioni mee subiacerent, illis libencius renunciarem, quam unius momenti spacio carere vellem dulcissimo Deo meo; idcirco toto nunc ex corde ignosco et remitto eisdem, quod in me deliquerunt.” She was asked by her confessor first whether she had left behind those things which are harmful to her, since, as he said, otherwise he would hardly presume to give her the holy body of Christ. Responding suddenly with a great outspokenness of mind, she said: “If all the kingdoms of this world were to submit themselves to my authority, gladly would I renounce them—that is how much I would be willing to deprive myself of them in one moment, for the sake of my most beloved God; on that account I now completely forgive and dismiss those things which were lacking in me.” Quibus dictis, tantam talemque uim sibi intulit remittendo, quod sanguis mox de ipsius ore et naribus exiliuit, confessore suo presente pariter et uidente. When she had said this, she felt such a great power, and so much of it, rush upon her in surrendering that suddenly blood burst forth from her mouth and nostrils. Her confessor was there with her and saw this. Quoniam hec deuota Dei famula omnia mundi prospera et aduersa dispiciens pro nichilo reputauit, ut Christum solum lucrifaceret, ideo gaudium et consolacionem Sancti Spiritus multiplicem accipere meruit in presenti et gloriam in futuro. This devoted servant of God, despising all the favorable and unfavorable things of the world, reckoned them as nothing, in order that she might gain Christ alone. Therefore she was worthy to receive the manifold joy and and consolation of the Holy Spirit in the present, and glory in the future. Huic quoque iam in monasterio existenti donum ualde mirificum et gloriosum contulit inmensa pietas conditoris, quod preterire silencio congruum non putamus. The immense mercy of the Creator also granted a very wonderful and glorious gift to her while she was living in the monastery, which we cannot pass over in silence. Siquidem in nocte festiuitatis sacratissime natalis Domini, infra mattutinarum missarumque sollempnia tunc pariter celebranda, in retrochoro se collocarat, utpote debilis et infirma, nec ualens cantatibus coequari. Indeed, on the night of the most holy festival of the Nativity, during the solemnities of Matins and Mass, she sat down in the rear of the choir, as she was frail and weak and not feeling up to the singing. Cumque interim orationibus ardentissime deuocionis uacaret, subito beatis occulis uisibiliter uidere meruit Dominum Sabaoth, in quem desiderant angeli prospicere. When, however, she gave herself up to prayers of the most passionate devotion, suddenly she was deemed worthy to see, openly and with blessed eyes, the Lord of Hosts,“Dominum Sabaoth” from the Hebrew צבאות (Tzevaot)—in this context, Christ. whom even the angels desire to glimpse. In specie infantis tenerrimi nimiumque decori, qui sibi fuerat diuinitus presentatus. He was present to her through divine inspiration, in the form of a very beautiful child of tender age. Quem iocunditate et leticia ineffabili intuens et agnoscens suum esse et omnium saluatorem, anima ipsius tota liquefacta est pre inmensa dulcidine et amore illius dulcissimi paruuli, eum sibi totis astringere affectibus desiderans, sed tamen sanctum sanctorum manibus c..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n Medieval European universities were often organized into a variable number of ‘Nations’ ( nationes ), semi-independent associations which grouped together students and masters on a broadly geographical basis. The University of Paris had four Nations: the French, the Picard, the Norman, and the English/German one. Compiled by the proctors (elective officials) of the Nations, the ‘books of the proctors of the Nations’ (libri procuratorum nationis ) were registers containing chronological entries which documented any significant information about the academic, social, and political life of each Nation and of the university in general. Needless to say, these are sources of unparalleled value when studying early universities. The original manuscripts of the English/German Nation, which survive for most of the 14th and 15th centuries, are currently kept at the Bibliothèque de la Sorbonne in Paris; the manuscript to which the passage belongs is Reg. 5 (fols. 50r-v). \n Introduction to the Text \n Composed in Paris in early 1413, this Latin passage comes from a book of the proctors of the English/German Nation at the medieval University of Paris. Its author is Johannes de Reno, a master of the University, who was proctor of the Nation at the time. The writing style is simple and almost rushed, reflecting the practical character of the books of the proctors (more on this below). The passage recounts the events surrounding a curious incident which occurred between the scholars of the Collège d’Harcourt and the host of a nearby Parisian lodging house in late 1412. After one of the horses of the lodging house is found dead in front of the Collège, some students repeatedly visit the house and ask for the carcass to be removed, but to no avail; the host even directs ridiculing and vulgar words at them. The angry students therefore drag the carcass back to the lodging house themselves. Later, in the middle of the night, some of the guests of the house and other Parisian burghers attack the Collège, and an extremely violent fight ensues; the situation is partially redressed only through the intervention of the Provost. The passage is interesting because it does not only exemplify the adversarial relationship between ‘town’ and ‘gown’, i.e. local residents and members of the university community, in a town such as Paris, but it can also be useful to observe the impact of current political developments on the university community. The passage can in fact be situated in the context of the Hundred Years’ War and the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War: in their attack to the Collège, the guests of the lodging house appear to have been motivated by political revenge against its Norman residents, as Normandy had proven to be a troublesome region during the preceding years of war. \n Further Reading \n Kibre, Pearl.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The sole known manuscript of the riddle is Fondation Georges et Mathilde Salem MS Syr 6, one of the hundreds of manuscripts collected by Syriac Catholic priest Paul Sbath (1887-1945) that remains in his hometown of Aleppo (formerly Sbath MS 900). It was copied in September 1684 and also includes an Arabic translation of the Book of the dove by Bar Hebraeus (1226-1286), an important Syriac text on asceticism. The Arabic Life of Moses the Ethiopian (d. ca. 395) was copied separately and later bound with these texts. The entire volume is thus written in the Arabic language, but the vast majority of it is actually in Arabic Garshuni—that is, Arabic written in the Syriac script. Interestingly, the text of the riddle is copied in Arabic script, but the commentary on it is copied in Garshuni, making it easy to distinguish text and commentary visually. This may have been done to preserve the original form of the Arabic text associated with Ḥunayn, but it is not explained.  The scribe of this manuscript is Yūḥanná ibn al-Jarīr al-Zarbābī, who was a West Syrian priest (member of the Syriac Orthodox Church) in Damascus. This shows that al-Zarbābī was not limited to copying texts by members of his own Church, like the Book of the dove , but was interested enough in this riddle to copy it in spite of its association with two figures from the rival Church of the East.  The condition of the manuscript is unknown due to the lengthy civil war in Syria, but it was photographed in 2008 and digitized by the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML). It is available for viewing at https://w3id.org/vhmml/readingRoom/view/501459 . The text of the riddle appears on fol. 82v-83r and the commentary on fol. 83v-93v. \n Introduction to the Text \n The rubric of this text explains its existence in the most dramatic way: it was purportedly found in the temple of Saturn (Arabic Zuḥal ), written on a golden tablet, at some unspecified ancient date. The location of the “temple of Saturn” is also not specified, but we may assume that it is meant to be located somewhere in Iraq or upper Mesopotamia, perhaps in the city of Harran, famous in the early Islamic period for its lingering cult of astrological polytheism. The rubric next tells us that the text was later rediscovered in “ancient pages” and translated into Arabic by Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq (ca. 809-873), an East Syrian Christian (member of the Church of the East) who became famous as the most important figure in the Baghdad translation movement that brought ancient philosophical and scientific texts into Arabic under the early ʻAbbāsid caliphs. The source language from which the riddle was translated is not stated, but is likely meant to be Syriac. Ḥunayn may in fact be responsible for the composition and/or translation of this text, but it is entirely possible that he is mentioned pseudonymously in order to associate the text with one of the most famous Christian scholars to write in Arabic. The text is accompanied by a commentary by ʻAmanúʼél d-Bét Garmay (d. 1080), an East Syrian metropolitan (archbishop) from northern Iraq (modern Kirkuk).  The rubric identifies the text as a “riddle” or “enigma” ( lughz ), but it fits uneasily in the context of other Arabic texts that use this term. Arabic riddles are generally written in an interrogative format and often in poetic meter, while this text is prose. There is no obvious “riddle” that could be answered here, but it seems the term is used to emphasize the cryptic nature of the text and its need for explanation, a task that ʻAmanúʼél attempts in his commentary. The riddle paints an apocalyptic picture that draws both on astrological references and on the story of Noah’s flood, especially in its Qur’anic form. It tells of a selfish king who decides, in a time of crisis, to pursue his own individual goals and abandon his kingdom to ruin. In the commentary, not included here, ʻAmanúʼél interprets the text as an allegory for the coming of Christ and the rise of Christianity, arguing that many philosophically-minded non-Christians have some awareness of Christian truth, even if they express it in different terms. The end of the commentary is lost, as noted by the scribe who copied this manuscript from an incomplete exemplar.  In addition to the fascinating frame story that is provided for this text, it is interesting for its apparent connection to nearly every major religious tradition of the early medieval Middle East, including less widely known traditions such as Harranian polytheism. Many Christians of this period were deeply aware of their non-Christian neighbors, and some of them drew on this knowledge to compose an enigmatic and intriguing text. Nevertheless, there has so far been little to no scholarly attention paid to the text. \n Further Reading \n Bencheneb, M. “Lug̲h̲z.”  Encyclopaedia of Islam , 2nd ed., Brill, 2012.

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n “Atressi cum l’orifans” is extant in a large number of manuscripts, which may indicate that when chansonniers were composed, Rigaut’s works were held in higher esteem than in scholarly assessments. Across manuscripts, the lyric changes, be it in the order of stanzas, the presence/absence of stanzas, single words and phrases, linguistic makeover, or the presence of a written melody (extant in two manuscripts). Rigaut seems to have been popular in Northern French chansonniers , although Eliza Zingesser has shown that this came at the cost of making Rigaut look birdlike, almost a madman (2020, 49–80).  This translation is based on the edition of the lyric by Carl Appel (1920, 70–71, item 29), with adapted punctuation. The reference edition remains that by Alberto Varvaro (1960, 106-134). \n Introduction to the Text \n “Atressi cum l’orifans” (PC 421.2: “Just as the Elephant”) is a canso attributed to Rigaut de Berbezilh. There is contention as to when the troubadour was active: 1140-1157, or 1170-1210 (Varvaro 1960, 9–30). This lyric has attracted commentary because, like other songs by Rigaut, it relies on animal imagery to further the singer-lover’s rationale. If one dates Rigaut’s activity to 1140-1157, “Just as the Elephant” is one of the earliest Romance texts to attest to the circulation of such imagery, at times in direct connection with the Physiologus . The “I” likens himself to the elephant, the bear, the phoenix, and the stag, as well as Daedalus (who stands for Icarus). These animal images thematise the opposing or the conjoining of up and down, pain and improvement, death and revival, fleeing and returning, and are linked to the complex feelings of love that the “I” expresses. Amelia Van Vleck has discussed the way in which these elements, along with elements denoting spectacles or trials, are picked up by words denoting excess, such as “sobramar” (loving excessively) and “trop parlar” (speaking too much) (1993, 232).  The reference to the “cortz del Puey” (court of Puy) is one of the rare testimonies to the existence of a poetic contest in Puy-en-Velay. More generally, the poem emphasises the communal nature of the lover’s endeavour, supported as he asks to be by his fellow “fis amans” (refined lovers), and his ability to stand is dependent upon them. The reference to Daedalus also deserves mention because, although what is said about him applies to Icarus, it attests to some form of knowledge about Ovid’s Metamorphoses . \n Further Reading \n Appel, Carl, editor.

    "textauthor": "Anonymous",
    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The text used for this translation is taken from the Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia , a 16th-century compilation written in Ruthenian from the Świdzinski Miscellany of Lithuanian Chronicles , once part of the Krasiński Collection. Unfortunately, the manuscript itself burned during World War II; however, paleographic descriptions by Evfimii Karskii and Franciczek Pułaski provide necessary information about its contents, while individual texts, including The Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia , were published by Afanasii Fedorovich Bychkov in 1893 and later in Polnoe sobranie russkikh letopisei . Two versions of the Chronicle are known: the shorter version was witnessed by the lost Krasiński copy and the longer version by the Alshevskii, Archeographic, Patriarch, Rumiantsev (Moscow, Russian State Library, Collection 37, № 435), and Tikhonravov copies.  The manuscript used in this translation represents the second redaction of the Chronicle , in which the account of the Roman descent of the Lithuanians first appears. The Chronicle is written in Ruthenian, the written language of the ethnic East Slavic population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland. This area, generally referred to as Ruthenia, corresponds to portions of modern-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, and southern Russia. \n Introduction to the Text \n Compiled in the 1520s, the Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia (henceforth Chronicle ) is an original composition of unknown authorship. Aristocratic in tone, the Chronicle includes a description of the legendary origins of the Lithuanian princes and nobles: that they descended from Roman patricians who, under the leadership of Prince Palemon, fled the tyranny of Emperor Nero. It was likely compiled at the court of the powerful magnate Albertas Goštautus while he was the Voivode (governor) of Vilnius and Grand Chancellor of Lithuania from 1522 to 1539. Most scholars agree that the Chronicle ’s focus on Lithuania’s noble origins suggests that it was used in the 16th century as a historical justification for Lithuania’s autonomy in its union with Poland and to distinguish Lithuania from neighboring Slavic realms.  The Polish historian Jan Długosz (1415-1480) was the first to write in a work of history the idea that the Lithuanians descended from Roman patricians in his Chronicles of the Kingdom of Poland . It is likely that the anonymous author of the Chronicle found this information in Długosz’s work and developed a detailed and dynamic narrative of the foundation of the Lithuanian state. The Chronicle  opens with an enumeration of the Roman emperors from Augustus to Nero, and attributes the flight of Palemon, the legendary founder of Lithuania and Nero’s relative, to Nero’s tyranny. It describes how Palemon, along with four well-known noble Roman families by the names of Centaurus, Columna, Rose and Ursini, and five hundred others, sailed to Lithuania in search of a safe place to live. The remainder of the text provides vivid descriptions of the great beauty and abundance of what would become Lithuanian lands and describes how names were chosen for important cities. It also provides a genealogical record of Palemon’s progeny and founded important cities and regions in Lithuania. In fact, the text credits Palemon’s son Kernus with giving the Lithuanians their name by combining the words riverside “litus” and pipe “tuba” which became “Litustuba” in Latin and “Litva” in Ruthenian.  The Chronicle is ambiguous about the temporal and geographical settings of the events it describes. Besides the year of Christ’s birth and mention of Palemon’s flight during Nero’s reign, no dates or indicators of time are provided. Moreover, Palemon, a figure from antiquity, is anachronistically tied to prominent Roman families from the Middle Ages. Additionally, many of the cities and other locations in the text cannot be linked to existing 16th-century locations. These ambiguities reflect the legendary nature of the Chronicle ’s narrative and suggest that its author intended to emphasize the antiquity of the Lithuanian state and its nobility.  Scholars today argue that the Chronicle ’s portrayal of Lithuanians’ ancient Roman roots speaks to the 16th-century Lithuanian nobility’s historical and political consciousness. By linking the 16th-century Lithuanian state to Roman culture and history, the Chronicle ’s author(s) influenced future official state historiography and political doctrine, as well as conceptions of collective identity. In fact, Uladzimir Kananovich (see Further Reading below) has argued that the Chronicle speaks more to the political and cultural reality of the 16th century than to the much earlier period it describes. Some of the names of rulers and noble families mentioned in the Chronicle belong to well-known noblemen of the 15th and 16th centuries, suggesting the author(s)’ intent to legitimize co..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The Dīvān , in which the aforementioned poem appears, was published in Bombay in 1910 by Khan Sahib M.M. Shirazi. The collection contains 14,000 distichs that mainly revolve around religious themes, such as eschewing the nafs [carnal soul], performing the dhikr , and abandoning the cupidity of worldly substance and goods, among others. \n Introduction to the Text \n Sanā’ī of Ghazna (d. 1131 C.E.) was the first major poet of classical Persian Sufi literature. He was a monumental poet not just because of his versification skills, but also because of his profound influence upon Sufi poets such as ‘Aṭṭār of Kadkan (d. 1225 C.E.) and Mawlavī (Rumi) (d. 1273 C.E.). “On the Merciful God and on the Birds’ Glorifications,” in the Dīvān [collection of poems], is a qaṣīda (laudatory poem) comprising three key themes: nature, the centrality of the Sufi concept of dhikr (remembrance) to man’s salvation, and tawḥīd (the Oneness of God).  At the very beginning of the poem, Sanā’ī depicts one of the blessings of God, which is in the form of bountiful rain. Spring is the ideal setting for the poet to portray the avian species’ glorifications, not only because the revivification of nature takes place, but more importantly, because spring’s abundant rain is a sign of God’s forgiveness toward mankind. Dhikr —a central practice in Islamic esoterism, derived from the Qur’an—and tawḥīd are two themes communicated through multifarious talking birds, such as the humā —a mythical bird like an eagle, who acknowledges the Oneness of God by saying, “The Unequaled is One.” Medieval Persian authors deployed the bird metaphor to concretize abstract Sufi concepts (e.g., dhikr ). Further, the Qur’an—an important source of influence upon Muslim thinkers—likens birds to human communities (6/ Al-An‘ām : 38). Sanā’ī conceives of birds as purposeful signs for humans to make sense of the universe. The red pigeon, for instance, serves as a spiritual model for humans, saying huwa [He] “one-hundred times with each breath.”   The poem contains abundant stylistic features. Sanā’ī’s use of periphrasis is seen in “The Riḍwān  (an angel) opens all the gates of Paradise,” which is a circumlocutory way of emphasizing divine blessings in springtime. He employs sensory imagery: olfactory (“qālīyih” [a fragrant substance comprising musk, ambergris, and pussy willow], “mounds of camphor,” etc.), auditory (“wind’s blowing,” “cock’s crow,” “wailing,” etc.), tactile (“silk and ermine coat,” etc.), kinesthetic (“quivering trees,” “lark’s strut,” etc.), and thermal (“autumn”). This rich imagery provides the reader with a vivid picture of nature. The poet’s allusion to 55/ Al-Raḥmān : 70 (“ ‘good and beautiful ones’ ”) illustrates that he was inspired by the Qur’an. Other stylistic features include alliteration (“character and customs” [ sīrat va sān ]) and consonance (“the Omnipotent Subduer” [ qādir-i qahhār ]). Finally, in classical Persian literature, it was common for poets to address themselves—especially at the end of poems—by using their pen names; the final distich that includes the poet’s pen name (i.e., Majdūd ) in a qaṣīda is called takhallus . Sanā’ī’s use of takhallus might convince his audience to take his sermon seriously: whilst the poet pleads with his readers to shun the indulgences of the fleeting world, he acknowledges in the final distich that he needs to purify his own soul (“ Majdūd ! You are closer to this state, for / Old age has indeed summoned autumn”).  \n Further Reading \n De Bruijn, J.T.P.

It is the oldest known manuscript to transmit Ausiàs March’s poetry, and an important witness to the transmission of the poetry of several other authors, including Pere Torroella and Lleonard de Sors. \n Introduction to the Text \n This poem was composed ca. 1410-1424 by Valencian author Jordi de Sant Jordi, a son of a Muslim convert and valet of the chamber of the king of the Crown of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous (1396-1458). It is believed to have been dedicated to the widowed Queen Margarida de Prades (1387-1429). The poem is written in Catalan with Occitan traits. It is in versos estramps , blank verses ending in unique, sonorous, words that are also known as rims fènix . Some of these rhyme words come from the famous sestina by Occitan troubadour Arnaut Daniel. Versos estramps in fact seem to be an evolution or an innovative version of the traditional sestina .  This love poem features a sustained and multifaceted praise of the lady with attention to both her physical and moral beauty as well as a declaration of the steadfast love of the lyric voice.

There was a man in the East by the name of Nobody, and this man was as another Job among all the Easterners. Magnus namque erat iste Nemo sanctus: magnus in genere et prosapia, magnus in potencia, magnus in scientia, magnus in clemencia &lt;et&gt; in compassione, magnus in honore et reuerentia. For that Nobody was a great saint: great in origin and lineage, great in power, great in learning, great in mercy and in compassion, great in honor and reverence. Hec autem omnia supra dicuntur ex sacra scriptura, cui nephas est reclamandum et contradicendum. More is said of him than all others in sacred scripture, which it is a sin to protest or speak publicly against. Item Nemo, dico, primo fuit magnus in genere et prosapia et similis Ade, qui fuit nec creatus nec genitus sed formatus I say first that Nobody was great in origin and lineage and was like Adam, who was not begotten or born but was formed, as the prophet says: Days will be formed and Nobody in them. Fuit eciam de genere militari, unde apostolus: Nemo militans deo. Furthermore he was of a warlike origin, hence the apostle says: Nobody fighting for God. Imo fuit nobilitate miles qui propriis et non alienis stipendiis militauit, unde illud apostoli: Indeed, he was a soldier of renown, who served at his own expense and not others’, hence the following, of the apostle: Nobody serves as a soldier at his own expense. Eciam fuit de genere non qualicumque sed regali, Ecclesiastici ii: Nemo ex regibus sumpsit exordium. Furthermore, he was not of a common but a regal origin, as in Ecclesiastes 2: Nobody began life among kings. Eciam fuit de cognacione uirginis gloriose eo quod fuerit de stirpe regia et de cognacione Elizabet, Luc 1: Nemo est in cognacione tua. For he was of the relatives of a glorious virgin, who was of a regal lineage, and of the relatives of Elizabeth, as in Luke 1: Nobody is among your relatives. Nec fuit solum de stirpe regia sed cum ipso deo legitur semper regnaturus, Ecclesiastici xxi: ‘Nemo semper regnaturus.’ Nor was he only of a regal lineage, but it is said of him by God himself that he will reign forever, Ecclesiastes 21: Nobody will reign forever. Secundo, dixi, iste Nemo magnus fuit in potencia, prius quia aperit quod deus claudit, unde illud: Deus claudit et Nemo aperit. Second, I said this Nobody was great in power, because he opens what God closes, hence the following: God closes and Nobody opens. Iob 12: Si incluserit hominem, Nemo est qui aperiat. Job 12: If God imprisons a man, it is Nobody who can release him. Item de manu dei audacter eripit, Iob 2: Cum sit Nemo qui de manu tua possit eruere. He also takes boldly from the hand of God, as in Job 2: Since it is Nobody who can pluck [me] from your hand. Item edifficat quod deus destruit, unde Iob: Si deus destruit, Nemo est qui edifficat. He also builds up what God destroys, hence Job: If God destroys it, it is Nobody who can build it up. Item ipsum deum superat et uincitt, Ecclesiastici ii: Nemo uincit deum. He also surpasses and conquers God himself, as in Ecclesiastes 2: Nobody conquers God. Propterea quod deus fecit, iste Nemo illa potest facere si uoluerit, sicut dixit Nicodemus in ewangelio: For this reason God made it so that this Nobody could do whatever he wanted, just as Nicodemus says in the Gospel: Item gaudium ab apostolis potenter tollit, unde in ewangelio: Et gaudium tuum Nemo tollet a uobis. Imo quod maius est, animam a Christo rapit: Animam meam Nemo tollit. Indeed, what is greater, he takes away life from Christ: Nobody takes away my life.

Furthermore, he was great in learning, chiefly in grammar, describing him thus with Priscian himself affirming: I have found Nobody my peer. Fuit enim magnus in arismetrica, secundum illud apostoli: Nemo poterat dinumerare turbam. For he was great in arithmetic, according to the apostle, as follows: Nobody could number the crowd. Fuit magnus in musica, item Apocalypsis: Nemo poterat dicere canticum. He was great in music, also in Revelation: Nobody could sing that song.

The Goliards were young clergymen and university students who became poets and writers and were often critical of the church. Scholars have speculated that the Cambridge Songs Manuscript may have been a songbook for wandering minstrels, though it is more likely to have belonged to a court. The original was probably compiled in France before the Norman Conquest in 1066 CE and was copied before being lost or destroyed, with the surviving copy making its way to the church of St. Augustine at Canterbury and eventually to Cambridge University. A number of the songs and poems in the manuscript were set to music by Carl Orff (1895-1982) in his famous cantata  Carmina Burana . \n Introduction to the Text \n De Heinrico (literally “ of Heinrich, ”  and here translated as “ The Song of Heinrich ” ) is a tenth-century historical narrative poem which gives an account of an Emperor called Otto greeting a Duke called Heinrich and handing over most of his power to him, though retaining his title. There has been considerable scholarly debate over who exactly Otto and Heinrich are, given that there are so many noblemen of those names in this period in Germany. The most popular explanations are that the poem is about either (1) Otto I the Great and his brother Heinrich, who were reconciled in 941 CE, or (2) Otto III, who was a small child when Heinrich the Quarrelsome was reconciled with the court and became regent in 991 CE.  A further puzzle presents itself in line 14, where Otto greets Heinrich saying “Welcome Heinrich, both of you with the same name.” There is little scholarly consensus as to who the second Heinrich with the same name could be, with some scholars even suggesting this accepted translation is completely wrong. Both Otto and Heinrich are portrayed as humble Christians who do not covet power.   The poem consists of eight stanzas, each with either three or four lines. The first half of each line is in Latin and the second half is in Old High German. \n Further Reading \n Bostock, John Knight, Kenneth Charles King, and D. R. McLintock.

Christe eleison. \n Introduction to the Source \n The song survives in only one manuscript, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Clm 6260, now held in Munich. The manuscript originally stems from the Freising Cathedral library and was written in the second half of the ninth century CE. It contains discussions, in Latin, of religious texts. The Song of Peter was written down later, on the very last page below the end of Hrabanus’s Maurus Commentary on Genesis (f.158v). \n Introduction to the Text \n The Song of Peter  is the oldest surviving hymn in the German language. Hymns are a form of religious poetry sung in praise of God, often during religious ceremonies such as the Mass celebrated by medieval Christians. The tradition of Christian hymns was popularised in the West by Ambrose of Milan (c.340 –397 CE), who wrote hymns in Latin (though some claim that Hilary of Poitiers was the first composer of Latin hymns). Hymns in the “ Ambrosian ”  style remained a very popular part of Christian worship until the Council of Trent (1545-63 CE), when most hymns were abolished from Catholic liturgical practice. The Song of Peter is transmitted with neumes, an early medieval form of musical notation, which suggests that it was supposed to be sung, possibly during religious processions.  Written down in the first third of the tenth century CE in a Bavarian dialect of the Old High German language, it is one of the earliest examples of end rhyme in a German text. This was a change from the Germanic alliterative verse which dominated earlier, where the same consonants were repeated within the same line. It is unknown whether the author of the Song of Peter  was influenced by the end rhymes of Otfrid of Weißenburg's Gospel Harmony (composed c.870 CE) or whether the Song of Peter predates Otfrid’s work.  The song calls upon St. Peter the Apostle in three strophes of three lines. Each strophe ends with the refrain, “ Kyrie eleyson. Christe eleyson ” , which is Greek for “ God, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. ”  The refrain points to Peter's special role in the Christian faith as the overseer of admission into Heaven (see, for example, the Biblical passage Matthew 16:19: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven ” ). \n Further Reading \n Bostock, John Knight, Kenneth Charles King, and D.

Completely drunk, I wrote this piece to express my longing for ZiyouZiyou was the younger brother of the speaker… 明月幾時有， How long will the full moon last? 把酒問青天。 I raise my wine cup and ask the azure sky. 不知天上宮闕， I wonder: in the palace up in the skyAccording to ancient Chinese folklore, there was a palace on the moon named Guanghan Palace 广寒宫, where a goddess resided by an osmanthus tree with her rabbit. “The palace up in the sky” refers to this palace., 今夕是何年。 Which year is it tonightIn Chinese mythology, a day in the human world is a year on the moon. By asking what year it is on the moon, the speaker is also asking what day it is in the human world.? 我欲乘風歸去， I want to ride the wind and returni.e. to the palace mentioned in the previous line., 又恐瓊樓玉宇， yet I fear that in the jade and crystal mansion up there, 高處不勝寒。 so lofty and high, one cannot stand the cold. 起舞弄清影， I rise and dance with my own pure shadow; 何似在人間。 am I still in the world of men? 轉朱閣， The moon turns at the vermillion pavilion, 低綺戶， Hanging down at the carved window 照無眠。 and shining on sleepless me. 不應有恨， It cannot have pity on men, 何事長向別時圓。 yet why does it only become a full moon when people are apart? 人有悲歡離合， Men grieve, rejoice, separate, and reunite; 月有陰晴圓缺， The moon dims or brightens, waxes or wanes. 此事古難全。 Since antiquity, such things have never been perfect. 但願人長久， We can only hope that all our friends and families can live long lives, 千里共嬋娟。 Looking at the moon together, across a thousand miles. \n Introduction to the Text \n Su Shi wrote this song on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, a harvest festival on the full moon, to express his homesickness after a seven-year separation from his brother. It includes broader philosophical reflections on happiness, sorrow and separation. It is interesting to note how Su Shi draws connections between the moon’s shape and the grieving, rejoicing, separating and reuniting of human beings. In ancient China, a full moon was a metaphor for happiness and fulfilled goals, whereas a moon that wasn't full meant loss and regret.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Su Shi  蘇軾 is one of the most popular Chinese poets of all time, and certainly one of the best-known poets of the Song Dynasty. Among his many roles - principled politician, esteemed poet, celebrated calligrapher - he was also a major reformer of the ci genre. Before Su Shi, the primary form of ci was wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful'). This was considered to be an inferior form of literature due to its thematic focus on love and desire and its association with the courtesans who usually performed it. Su Shi wrote lyrics on a broad range of non-traditional topics, often closely related to his own life experience. His compositions dealt with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. As a pioneer of the háofàng (豪放, 'bold') type of ci , he incorporated references to typically masculine pursuits, including frequent use of a hunting motif. He also frequently incorporated ideas from Buddhist philosophy and allusions to political events, which usually appeared only in more elevated forms of poetry.

He once pursued a tiger on horseback, managing to kill it even though it had bitten his horse.

The Prefect of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, successfully defeated the invading Xiongnu troops but was deprived of his official title because his battle report stated a number of enemies killed that was six fewer than the actual number. Feng Tang, a court official, defended the prefect and convinced Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180-157 BCE) that his sentence was too severe. The emperor thus sent Feng Tang to pardon the prefect and restore the latter’s title. Here the speaker refers to himself as the prefect and hopes to retrieve the court’s trust and favor. The order of the words in the original has been modified in the translation to make the sentence easier to understand. The literal translation of this line and the preceding line is: “Going into Yunzhong with a Fu Jie; / When will the court dispatch Feng Tang?”? 會挽雕弓如滿月, By that time I will pull my carved bow into the shape of a full moon, 西北望, aim to the northwest, 射天狼。 and shoot down SiriusIn ancient China, “Sirius” was the name given to a star that was commonly believed to control warfare. “Shoot down Sirius” indicates the speaker’s wish to defeat major rivaling states, very likely the Western Xia in the northwest, which was a great threat to the Northern Song court… \n Introduction to the Text \n This song was written in 1075 CE when the poet was prefect of Mizhou. The first stanza describes a hunting trip in which many local people participated: a sign of their respect for Su Shi. As a gesture of gratitude, Su Shi wishes he could undertake a heroic act like Sun Quan, a king who famously shot a tiger to prove his courage. In the second stanza, by comparing himself to Wei Shang, a famous Han Dynasty prefect who was once deprived of his official title but later had his position restored, Su Shi expresses both a desire to be recognized again by the imperial court, and a willingness to take on responsibility for defending the country's frontiers.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

He uses the same rhyming schemes as Zhang Zhifu to depict the capricious nature of willow catkins. Although Su Shi is known for the bold style of his songs, this song is a good example of his facility at describing subtler images and emotions. The imagery of blown catkins (柳絮) suggests an unsettled, tragic life without a sense of belonging. Here Su Shi elaborates on these implications, but also provides new meanings for the imagery.

Su Shi renovated the Yellow Tower while he was posted in Pengcheng. 爲餘浩嘆。 I hope that someone will utter a long sigh for me. \n Introduction to the Text \n In 1078 CE, the poet was the Prefect of Xuzhou. The poem was written when he spent a night in the Swallow Tower, one of the five most famous towers in Xuzhou, and dreamt about Guan Panpan, a courtesan who dwelt in Swallow Tower during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE). Su Shi had an unfortunate political career, during which he was often exiled and reassigned. His feelings about this can be seen in the first three lines of the second stanza, in which the poet expresses his exhaustion from all the travelling required by his constant reassignments, as well as his longing for his hometown. This world-weariness spurs philosophical reflections on life, which he regards as dream-like and illusory. The sentiment that all lived experience is a dream strongly connotes Buddhist thought, specifically one of the Buddist classic texts, the Diamond Sutra .     The Diamond Sutra is an important Buddhist scripture which contains the discourse of the Buddha to a senior monk, Subhuti. The major themes are anatman (not-self), the emptiness of all phenomena and the liberation of all beings from attachments. Buddhism developed in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) and the Five Dynasties period (907-960 CE), and continued to prosper under the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty government supported and organized the translation and publication of various Sutras; multiple commentaries on Sutras were also produced during this period. Most of the Song Dynasty emperors either believed in Buddhism or supported its spread. The most dominant faction was the Zen Buddhism of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and the Diamond Sutra was considered to be one of their most influential texts, well-known both to the non-secular and secular world.   Su Shi himself was highly influenced by Buddhism; his brother was very invested in Buddhist philosophy and practices, as were his second wife, Wang Runzhi, and his later partner, Zhaoyun. Throughout his life, he befriended many monks and incorporated Buddhist practices into his life through copying Sutras, building pagodas and temples and painting figures of Buddha. Su Shi’s lines on the dream-like quality of existence in this ci likely comes from the four-line gatha at the end of Section 26 of the Diamond Sutra: “All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, like an ill..."

It often implies a sentiment of rejecting or being bored by this kind of lifestyle, and wanting to have something truthful (love, tranquility, or religious belief) which will transcend the pursuit of money or fame. It may also bear a spiritual meaning, in which the “dusty world” signifies the mortal world… 書此語橋柱 Thus I wroteWith a writing brush specifically for calligraphy. this on one of the pillars of the bridge. 照野瀰瀰淺浪， The moon shines on the wild fields; low waves surge on the vast water. 橫空隱隱層霄。 Across the sky are dim layers of clouds. 障泥未解玉驄驕。 The saddle is still tied to my fine, strong steed. 我欲醉眠芳草。 Yet I want to lie in drunkenness among the grass and flowers. 可惜一溪風月， How lovely, the beautiful moonlit view and the refreshing breeze on the creek. 莫教踏碎瓊瑤。 Do not let it trample the jade-like reflection of the creek into pieces“It” refers to the horse.! 解鞍欹枕綠楊橋。 I untie the saddle, lean on it as a pillow, and lie on the Lü Yang bridge. 杜宇一聲春曉。 The cuckoo utters one cry and it is already dawn of a spring day. \n Introduction to the Text \n Su Shi was demoted and transferred to Huangzhou when he opposed reforms to the Imperial Examination System (which selected new civil servants) instituted by the chancellor at the Song court, Wang Anshi. This ci was written during his posting in Huangzhou. In the first stanza, the speaker highlights the beauty of a moonlit view of the city. Beholding a landscape far removed from the noisy, complicated, political world that he had come from, Shu Shi purports to have written this song in calligraphy on a pillar of a bridge.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Su Shi  蘇軾 is one of the most popular Chinese poets of all time, and certainly one of the best-known poets of the Song Dynasty. Among his many roles - principled politician, esteemed poet, celebrated calligrapher - he was also a major reformer of the ci genre. Before Su Shi, the primary form of ci was wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful'). This was considered to be an inferior form of literature due to its thematic focus on love and desire and its association with the courtesans who usually performed it. Su Shi wrote lyrics on a broad range of non-traditional topics, often closely related to his own life experience. His compositions dealt with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. As a pioneer of the háofàng (豪放, 'bold') type of ci , he incorporated references to typically masculine pursuits, including frequent use of a hunting motif. He also frequently incorporated ideas from Buddhist philosophy and allusions to political events, which usually appeared only in more elevated forms of poetry.  Although Su Shi was a hig..."

    "body": " 西江月 To the tune “The Moon Over the West River”This song was written in 1079 when the speaker passed by the city of Yangzhou. 平山堂 Pingshan HallPingshan Hall was the study of Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072 CE), who was a mentor to Su Shi. This whole song is a commemoration of the speaker’s beloved teacher. 三過平山堂下， By the time I stopped by the Pingshan Hall for the third timeSu Shi was transferred to Hangzhou as a Tong Pan (a court official in charge of food transportation and irrigation works); later he was transferred to Mizhou in 1074. By the time he wrote the song, it was his third time being transferred and passing by Pingshan Hall on his journey to the new posting., 半生彈指聲中。 Half of my lifetime had gone in a flick of the finger“A flick of the finger” refers to the transitory nature of time. It is a quantifier for time in Buddhist Scriptures. According to Buddhist Scriptures, the time period of twenty thoughts equals a moment, and twenty moments equal a flick of the finger… 十年不見老仙翁。 For ten years I have not seen the old immortalThe “old immortal” refers to the poet’s mentor and friend, Ouyang Xiu, who had already passed away when Su Shi wrote this song., 壁上龍蛇飛動。 On the walls, dragons fly and serpents moveThe “dragons” and “serpents” refer to Ouyang Xiu’s calligraphy… 欲弔文章太守， I want to commemorate the Prefect of Fine Composition, 仍歌楊柳春風。 but instead, I sing the song for the willow and the spring breeze“The willow”, “the spring breeze”, and “the Prefect of Fine Composition” all come from Ouyang Xiu’s ci “Seeing Liu Zhongyuanfu Off For His Departure to Guard Weiyang”. “The Prefect of Fine Composition” was originally used by Ouyang Xiu to describe his friend, Liu Zhongyuanfu, but here, Su Shi is using it to refer to Ouyang Xiu. “The willow” and “the spring breeze” imagery are taken from the same song: “The willow planted by me [i.e. Ouyang Xiu] in front of Pingshan Hall, after I left, has turned green many times in the spring breeze”. Ouyang Xiu’s song expresses a desire to live in the moment, which may also be the sentiment Su Shi wishes to convey with this line… 休言萬事轉頭空。 Do not say that all things become empty in a blink of an eye. 未轉頭時皆夢。 Even before your eyes blink, it is all just a dream. \n Introduction to the Text \n Ouyang Xiu, whose work is also included in this collection, was a highly respected and influential teacher of Su Shi. He built Pingshan Hall in 1048 CE. Before the composition of this song, Su Shi had passed by the hall twice due to transfers at work. The song marks the occasion of his third visit to Pingshan Hall, at which point Ouyang Xiu had long since passed away. The song serves to commemorate Su Shi’s teacher, as well as to reflect on the inconstancy of life; the latter effort is supported by Su Shi's use of Buddhist imagery, such as “a flick of the finger” to express the rapid passing of time. The final lines, especially the sentiment that lived experience is a dream, refer to the philosophy of the Diamond Sutra ( 金刚经 ).   The Diamond Sutra is an important Buddhist scripture which contains the discourse of the Buddha to a senior monk, Subhuti. The major themes are anatman (not-self), the emptiness of all phenomena and the liberation of all beings from attachments. Buddhism developed in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) and the Five Dynasties period (907-960 CE), and continued to prosper under the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty government supported and organized the translation and publication of various Sutras; multiple commentaries on Sutras were also produced during this period. Most of the Song Dynasty emperors either believed in Buddhism or supported its spread. The most dominant faction was the Zen Buddhism of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and the Diamond Sutra was considered to be one of their most influential texts, well-known both to the non-secular and secular world.   Su Shi himself was highly influenced by Buddhism; his brother was very invested in Buddhist philosophy and practices, as were his second wife, Wang Runzhi, and his later partner, Zhaoyun. Throughout his life, he befriended many monks and incorporated Buddhist practices into his life through copying Sutras, building pagodas and temples and painting figures of Buddha. Su Shi’s lines on the dream-like quality of existence in the final two lines of this ci likely come from the four-line gatha at the end of Section 26 of the Diamond Sutra : “All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion, like a bubble, like a shadow. Like dew or like a flash of lighting; thus we shall perceive them.”  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

Northerners believed that its air contained harmful vapors.? 冰肌自有仙風。 The skin, translucent as iceImagery of ice and jade was used to convey the beauty of women’s bodies, clean like ice and smooth like jade. It comes from a philosophical work by Zhuangzi, in which he uses “skin of ice and bones of jade” to describe a deity living in the Gu Ye Mountain. The phrase suggests an otherworldly quality to Zhaoyun’s beauty., was naturally endowed with a transcendent temperament. 海仙時遣探芳叢。 From time to time, the sea nymphsAccording to Chinese mythology, four dragon kings control the sea, but nymphs who live beneath the waves maintain its balance. This line implies that the plum blossom/Zhaoyun was so extraordinary that even the sea nymphs sought to learn about it/her. sent an envoy to explore this fragrant shrubRefers to the plum blossom.: 倒掛綠毛幺鳳。 a green-feathered bird like a phoenix, hanging upside downThis image of a remarkable bird as the envoy emphasises the specialness of the object of its research: the plum blossom/Zhaoyun. The phoenix has a special significance in Chinese mythology, and the color green is often associated with purity and luxury (and the jade already mentioned)… 素面常嫌粉涴， The natural face never liked being smudged by powder; 洗妝不褪唇紅。 after washing off its makeup, the rouge on its lips did not fade. 高情已逐曉雲空。 My lofty longings chased after the dawn cloudThe “dawn cloud” (曉雲, Xiao Yun) is a coded reference to Zhaoyun (朝雲): the only difference between the two Chinese words is the first character, yet these characters (曉 and 朝) are synonymous in Chinese, both meaning dawn, so the full expression means “dawn cloud” in both cases. Su Shi is using word play to hint that he’s writing about Zhaoyun. and vanished, 不與梨花同夢。 Sharing no dreams with the pear blossomsThis is a reference to a poem by a famous Tang Dynasty poet, Wang Changling 王昌龄. In the only surviving line of the poem, Wang Changling writes that after he saw plum blossoms, he dreamt of pear blossoms. By contrast, the final line here implies that Su Shi will not be dreaming of pear blossoms, i.e. he won’t think of Zhaoyun (his plum blossom) and dream of another woman (a pear blossom), and will remain faithful to his memory of her… \n Introduction to the Text \n This ci was written in 1096 CE, when Su Shi was sixty years old. It is a eulogy for Zhaoyun, who was a longtime female companion of Su Shi in his later life. The precise nature of her role (concubine, female servant, or courtesan accepted into his household) is contested by the scholars. Zhaoyun had accompanied the speaker to Huizhao in Guangdong, a coastal province in southeast China, when he was demoted by the Song court. The lyrics seem to be describing plum blossoms, but are actually using the image of a plum blossom as an extended metaphor for Zhaoyun’s beauty and pure heart. In Chinese culture, it is traditionally believed that the plum blossom flourishes in harsh conditions, blooming only in the winter. The metaphor therefore highlights how she was able to thrive in difficult circumstances.

    "body": " 江神子 To the tune “River God”This tune also goes by the name “River Town”, and “River Town” is the tune name for another of Su Shi’s poems in the collection, “Hunting in Mizhou”. 乙卯正月二十日夜記夢 Recording the Dream on the Night of the Twentieth of the First Month of 1075 CE 十年生死兩茫茫。 For ten years, the dead and the living have been separated by a vast and obscure distanceSu Shi’s first wife, Wang Fu, died in 1065 CE; by the time he wrote this song, it had been ten years since her death… 不思量。 I forced myself not to think of you, 自難忘。 But it is hard for me to forget. 千里孤墳, The solitary grave, a thousand miles away,Wang Fu was buried in Meizhou, far away from Su Shi’s current location in Mizhou. 無處話凄涼。 Nowhere to speak about this loneliness and misery of mine. 縱使相逢應不識, Even if we could meet, you would not recognize me. 塵滿面, Dust all over my faceDuring the Song Dynasty, people traveled by horse and carriage, and “Dust all over my face” implies that the poet traveled a lot during the ten years. It also suggests that a lot had happened to him, and that complicated life experiences had made the older poet very different from his younger self., 鬢如霜。 and the hair at my temples like frost. 夜來幽夢忽還鄉。 Yesterday night, in a mournful dream, I suddenly returned to my hometown. 小軒窗。 By the small window, 正梳妝。 you were combing your hair and doing your makeup. 相顧無言, We gazed at each other, speechless; 惟有淚千行。 only thousands of lines of tears coursed down. 料得年年腸斷處, I know your heart breaks for me year after year 明月夜, On moonlit nights, 短松岡。 upon the hill with the low pine trees. \n Introduction to the Text \n When Su Shi was nineteen, he married his first wife, a sixteen-year-old named Wang Fu. She died when she was only twenty-seven. This ci is a eulogy to Wang Fu. The first stanza depicts the loneliness and melancholy of the poet thinking about his late wife. The second stanza recalls a dream in which his wife is alive and well. In the final lines, he imagines his wife still longing for him from beyond the grave.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Su Shi  蘇軾 is one of the most popular Chinese poets of all time, and certainly one of the best-known poets of the Song Dynasty. Among his many roles - principled politician, esteemed poet, celebrated calligrapher - he was also a major reformer of the ci genre. Before Su Shi, the primary form of ci was wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful'). This was considered to be an inferior form of literature due to its thematic focus on love and desire and its association with the courtesans who usually performed it. Su Shi wrote lyrics on a broad range of non-traditional topics, often closely related to his own life experience. His compositions dealt with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. As a pioneer of the háofàng (豪放, 'bold') type of ci , he incorporated references to typically masculine pursuits, including frequent use of a hunting motif. He also frequently incorporated ideas from Buddhist philosophy and allusions to political events, which usually appeared only in more elevated forms of poetry.

    "body": " 卜算子 To the tune “Fortune Teller” 黃州定慧院寓居作 Composed while lodging at Dinghui Monastery in HuangzhouSu Shi was banished to Huangzhou. Without a place to live, and shunned by the locals who feared being implicated if they associated with him, he had no choice but to lodge at the monastery. 缺月挂疏桐， The waning moon hangs on the thinning sycamore tree. 漏斷人初靜。 The dripping clock stopsThe dripping clock is a water clock; when all the water drips down, the clock stops, indicating that it is midnight.; all men become quiet. 時見幽人獨往來， Sometimes I would see an isolated man come and go on his own 縹緲孤鴻影。 like the distant and vague silhouette of a lone wild goose. 驚起卻回頭， Startled, it flies up and turns its head; 有恨無人省。 It has resentment in its heart yet no one notices. 揀盡寒枝不肯棲， Picking from all the cold branchesThere is a Chinese proverb that “good birds choose branches (that suit them) to rest on”, which means that good officials should choose their kings carefully to ensure that they (the officials) will be allowed to pursue their ambitions. Here, Su Shi depicts the goose’s refusal to pick from the branches to imply that he is unwilling to pursue his political ambitions any further., but not resting on any, 寂寞沙洲冷。 It is alone and abandoned on the freezing isle of sand. \n Introduction to the Text \n Su Shi was demoted and transferred to Huangzhou when he opposed reforms to the Imperial Examination System (which selected new civil servants) instituted by the Song Court chancellor, Wang Anshi. Despite his diminished circumstances, he remained defiant and criticized others for going along with the reforms. In this song, he compares himself to a lone wild goose (鸿), conveying both pride in his choices and the loneliness of his new position. The wild goose was often used by Chinese poets to represent heroic figures with grand ambitions. A good example can be found in the Records of the Grand Historian ( 史记 ) by Sima Qian 司马迁, where a rebellion leader disparages his opponents with the following line: “How could swallows and sparrows understand the ambitions of wild geese and swans?”  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n The text used for this translation is taken from the St. Sophia First Chronicle, a fifteenth-century compilation written in Old Russian that belongs to a larger family of Novgorodian chronicles created during this period. This chronicle was named “St. Sophia” because nineteenth-century scholars had once (incorrectly) believed that the earliest versions had been composed by a fifteenth-century Novgorodian author in the St. Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod. Today, scholars think that the chronicle was composed by a Muscovite author.  The manuscript used in this translation is an example of the so-called “younger version” of the chronicle (a later copy of the St. Sophia First chronicle text). It is known as Tolstoy's Sophia I Chronicle , named after its owner, the collector Fyodor Andreevich Tolstoy (1758–1849). Today it is held by the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. In the St. Sophia First Chronicle, the “Testament of Magnus” spans 214r-a through 215r-a. It can also be found in other Novgorodian chronicles such as the Novgorod Karamzin Chronicle and the Fourth Novgorod Chronicle. It is likely that none of these three chronicles contains an original version of the “Testament;” they all seem to share a common textual source, today unknown. Overall, these chronicles preserve much of the same narrative content but each features omissions and additions. For example, the First Sophia Chronicle and Fourth Novgorod Chronicle track fairly closely up to entries dated 1418, when the main body of the First Sophia chronicle ends while the Fourth Novgorod Chronicle continues in the mid-fifteenth century. Furthermore, the First Sophia Chronicle’s content generally focuses less exclusively on Novgorod than the Fourth Novgorod Chronicle and Novgorod Karamzin Chronicle does. (See John H. Lind’s work in Further Reading for a discussion of fifteenth-century Russian chronicles.) \n Introduction to the Text \n Composed in fifteenth-century Rus (a medieval, primarily Slavic civilization located in what is today Eastern Europe), the “Testament of Magnus” is a “manuscript” allegedly authored by Magnus Eriksson, king of Sweden from 1319 to 1363 and Norway from 1319 to 1355, during his dying days in an Orthodox monastery. A popular Novgorodian tale, the “Testament” recounts the Swedish king’s unsuccessful military exploits in Novgorod— his 1348 campaign ended in complete defeat — and serves as a warning to his fellow Swedes to avoid going to war with the Rus people. Thus, the “Testament” promotes the Novgorod Republic’s military prowess and its role in protecting Rus’s interior lands from foreign invaders.  Dated to the year 6860 using the Mundane Era of Constantinople date system (1352 in the Julian calendar), the text opens with the explicit claim that it is the “Рᲂуукописание” (autograph manuscript) of King Magnus. The text recounts previous wars between the Swedes and Novgorodians dating back to the thirteenth century, namely failed exploits by Birger Magnusson and Tyrgils Knutson, both of whom were defeated by Rus princes (most notoriously, in the Battle of Neva in 1240 by Prince Alexander, whose attribute – Nevsky – derives from this victory). The second half of the text focuses on Magnus’s unsuccessful 1348 campaign. The narrator (allegedly Magnus) admonishes himself for breaking a peace treaty with Rus and capturing Novgorodian land. Like his predecessors, Magnus was unsuccessful. Fleeing the approaching Novgorodians, Magnus and his army were shipwrecked. Magnus’s misery continues: his lands suffer from civil war, illness, and famine. He goes insane and is locked up in a sanitorium. Magnus’s son Hakon frees Magnus from his confinement, but Magnus is once again shipwrecked. Floating on a piece of the wrecked ship, Magnus, a Roman Catholic, is saved by Orthodox monks from Rus, who baptize him and initiate him into monkhood. (The real-life Magnus had attempted to convert Novgorodians to Catholicism.) The text implies that the converted Magnus will die soon after writing this manuscript.  The “Testament of Magnus” is notable for its religious imagery. The text grafts familiar Christian tropes onto the story of Magnus’s sorrows. These sorrows begin first with Magnus’s violation of “крⷭ҇тноє целованіє” (kissing the cross), a medieval promise ritual popular in Rus. The narrating Magnus acknowledges multiple times that his suffering was due to violating the Peace Treaty of Nöteborg, which Magnus himself made with Novgorod in 1323. Like other important medieval oaths, the treaty was cemented by the kissing of the cross. Thus, God’s retribution humbles Magnus, causing the Swedish king to convert to Orthodox Christianity. Notably, in recounting the second shipwreck, the narrator describes himself as floating, having been pinned or nailed down by wooden planks (“исторцьнемъ пригвоꙁⷣихсѧ”), when the Orthodox monks find him — an allusion to Christ’s crucifixion.  Scholars today unequivocally reject the ..."

    "body": " Introduction to the Source \n Cronica , Sebastian Tinódi’s songbook of 1544, contains this song and twenty-one others together with his own musical compositions. It was printed in Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca, Romania). A few original copies are extant as facsimile editions. The source for this translation is the standardized transcription accessible on the Hungarian Electronic Library website,  Tinódi Sebestyén összes költeménye : http://mek.oszk.hu/01100/01100/index.phtml . \n Introduction to the Text \n This song, composed on April 24, 1542, was included in Cronica , Sebastian Tinódi’s printed song collection of 1554. The songs in Cronica were accompanied by melodies and intended for performance before varied audiences as well as for private reading. The general topic of the collection is the defensive struggle of Hungarians against the Ottoman armies, and its songs can be described as event poetry (a genre which typically combines a narrative account of contemporary, momentous events with implicit or explicit political-cultural commentary). Tinódi significantly advanced the genre of event poetry in Hungarian literature and became a model for those who followed.  In contrast to “The Loss of Buda and Captivity of Bálint Török” (also presented in the  Global Medieval Sourcebook ), this song exhibits fewer oral compositional elements and illustrates how Tinódi eventually developed a more definitive literate style with fewer formulae and repetitions. Nevertheless, for greater effect in performance, he deftly employs direct speech to admonish his audience and also to console his captive lord, Bálint Török.  In this song, Tinódi laments the entrapment of three Hungarian magnates by the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman government). Each magnate’s arrest is described along with the resulting personal misfortune for the family, even though details are sparingly given. The fate of these nobles then forms the basis for a comparison of Ottoman and Hungarian beliefs and actions. Primary themes are the guile of the Ottomans on the one hand, and on the other, the factiousness, gullibility, imprudence and lack of Christian morality of the Hungarians. The opening lament (stanzas 1-2) contrasts the dire situation for the Hungarians with Ottoman glee. As the Sublime Porte gains from Hungarian foolhardiness, several stanzas admonish Hungarian lords severely in a direct address (stanzas 3-7, 32-34). The implication is that the Ottomans are united under one sovereign and one belief system, whereas the Hungarians are constantly divided. Thus the song blames the Hungarians themselves for their country’s calamities. \n Further Reading \n Czigány, Lóránt, Oxford History of Hungarian Literature from the Earliest Times to the Mid-1970s .

And the pasha set out, arriving in EszékOsijek, Croatiarapidly sending to brave Bálint Törökhis summons with many gracious words:“All will go well; the sultan has promised” Nagy gongya lőn erre jó Terek Bálintnak,Eszt ő megjelönté fő-fő szolgáinak,Oly tanács adaték ez nemes úrfinak,Hitlevelét kérje az terek császárnak. This missive worries Török gravely,he conveys this to his most trusted retainers.They advise the nobly born man toask for safe conduct from the Turkish sultan. Úrfi így felele bánatos beszédben:„Ha én hitöt kérök az én levelemben,Kezd kétségök lenni az én hívségömben,De csak bízom magam én jó Istenömben. The nobleman responds with sorrowful words“If I ask for safe conduct in my letterthen they will begin to question my loyalty.Thus I place my trust in my own true God. Sokak szidnak engöm az hajas tereknek,Szerető uraim nyilván vagyon néktök,Terek barátsága úgy nem kell kedvemnek,Mint olyan hitetlen ragadozó ebeknek. Many defame me as the hairy Turk.My loving nobles, it’s clear to youthat I do not favor the friendship of the Turksbecause they are infidel dogs. Lám, mi nem láthatánk oly jó fejedelmet,Ki megrontja vala gonosz terek népet,Szabadítja vala ez keresztyén népet,Értök szerencsére vetöm én fejemet.” Now since we can find no good rulerwho could defeat the wicked Turkish armyand liberate our Christian nation,for them I will wager my head.” Indula, Tárdánál az táborban juta,Egy sátort az basa hamar vonyattata,Ott nagy tisztösséggel abban szállattatá,Fő-fő terekekkel néki udvartata.

And heTannaitic sources differ on whether “he” refers to the priest (Sifre Numbers 12) or a member of the court (Rabbi Yosi bar Ḥaninah, folio 7b below, may take either position.) Medieval witnesses (Meiri, Maimonides) have the plural (“they say”), clearly referring to the court, as do generally good Mishnah mss. (Parma, Kaufmann; the latter might be corrected to that reading.)says to her, “My daughter, much wine, much levity, much childishness, and many bad neighbors cause [sin]. Cause [rather] this [confession] forThe reading in the majority of mss., also reflected in a different formulation of Sifre Numbers, is “Do not cause his great name…” Other mss. read “…for the sake of His great name.” The printers have conflated the two readings.His great Name, written in holiness, that it may not be blotted out by the waters.” ואומר לפניה דברים שאינם כדישאינה כדאי (Liss 1977: 68, nn. 86 and 92). לשומען היא וכל משפחת בית אביה And he tells her of things that one Rashi and most mss.: “she should not hear.” Rashi comments that she is not permitted to hear the sins of the patriarchs [Mishnah, tractate Megillah 4:10: the sin of Reuben may be “recited but not translated in public”] but this case is an exception, as it may elicit her confession (like Judah and Reuben, who “confessed and were not ashamed”–see 7b below.) Meiri adds that the patriarchs’ sins and confessions will overwhelm even the most intransigent sotah–even if she is surrounded by the supportive presence of “her father’s house.” Meiri therefore interprets the Mishnah as “things that she cannot [bear to] hear,” rather than simply &quot;she should not hear.&quot;should not hear, [neither she] nor any relation of her father’s house. אם אמרה טמאה אני שוברת כתובתה ויוצאת ואם אמרה טהורה אני מעלין אותה לשער המזרחלשערי המזרח, לשערי מזרח (Liss 1977: 69, nn. 100-101).שעל פתח שער נקנור ששם משקין את הסוטות ומטהרין את היולדות ומטהרין את המצורעין If she said, “I am defiled,” she writes a receipt for her marriage-contract and she is released. But if she said, “I am pure,” they take her up to the Eastern Gate,Many witnesses and parallels read: “Eastern gates.” Rashi reads “Eastern gate” and comments that this is the outer gate from which one entered the Temple Mount–not the Niqanor or “upper” gate, which he places between the women’s courtyard and the courtyard of Israelites. Most other commentators read the Eastern and Niqanor gates as identical, as does Rashi himself in his commentary to Numbers (5:18). This contradiction may arise from Rashi’s reading of this Mishnah in the Gemara (bottom of 7b below), where the stam adds that “they take her up” from gate to gate “in order to wear her out.” In this context, then, Rashi sees the Niqanor Gate as the “upper gate,” with the sotah going up and down between the two gates. But as Saul Lieberman notes in his commentary to the parallel at Tosefta Sotah 1:4 (New York: JTS, 1967, vol. 8, 613), both ms. Parma of the Mishnah here and ms. Vienna of the Tosefta lack “Niqanor.” That name seems to have crept in later, as a clarification. The original reading was likely closer to Josephus, Antiquities III.6, who refers simply to &quot;the gates which face toward the Temple.&quot;at the entryway of the Niqanor Gate, where they give the sotah [bitter waters] to drink, and purify a [recently] delivered woman, and purify those with skin-affliction. וכהןוהכוהן (Liss 1977: 70, n. 116).אוחז בבגדיה אם נקרעו נקרעו ואם נפרמו נפרמו עד שהוא מגלה את לבה וסותר את שערה And aMedieval commentators (Tosafot; Meiri) and a parallel (Numbers Rabbah) read “the priest,” i.e. the priest who is chosen by lot to expose her body (Tosefta Sotah 1:7)–not just any priest. This reading is even reflected in the Gemara itself (II.b.iii below.)priest seizes her clothes–if they are torn, they are torn; if they are ripped, they are ripped–until he exposes her chest, and he uncovers her hair [and unbraids it]. רבי יהודה אומר אם היה לבה נאה לא היה מגלהו ואם היה שערה נאה לא היה סותרסותרו (Liss 1977: 71, n. 126).

The Queen of France is the final text of three in that manuscript. It is preceded by The Duke of Brunswick , a German rhymed couplet narrative; and by Loher and Maller , which is a German prose translation by Elisabeth von Nassau-Saarbrücken (or someone at her court) from a chanson de geste, an Old French heroic epic.  Heid. Hs. 1012 tells The Queen of France in a manner focused on the queen's steadfastness and virtue. By adding lines and by expanding on specific themes (e.g. a comparison between the queen and the Virgin Mary and the king's explicit joy at discovering that the queen has lived a virtuous and pious life without him), this version emphasizes the 'good wife' theme more than other versions, and in some cases suggests parallels with religious stories of martyrs and saints. \n Introduction to the Text \n The Queen of France was composed in the late 14th century somewhere in the Alemannic region (what is today Southern Germany or Austria). Two of 24 surviving manuscripts name one “von Schondoch” as the author of The Queen of France . Aside from the name, nothing else is known about this person. The Queen of France is a prototypical melodramatic tale. There are similar texts in the medieval German tradition, but they are usually shorter. This verse narrative, composed in rhymed couplets, is also unique because of its wide transmission. The large number of textual witnesses and adaptations of the story, among them Elisabeth von Nassau-Saarbrücken’s famous prose novel Sibille (after 1437), suggest that The Queen of France was very popular in late medieval Germany.  The Queen of France tells the story of a queen, a good and faithful wife, who is banished for alleged adultery by her husband, the king. Falsely accused by the king’s marshal, whose advances she had turned down earlier, the pregnant queen is saved from death by the intercession of the king’s nephew, the Duke of Austria. The queen is escorted away under the protection of a noble knight, who is assassinated by the villainous marshal. The queen, however, manages to elude the murderer, fleeing into the forest where she is sheltered by a virtuous, poor man. The story takes a turn for the better when the virtuous knight’s faithful dog persistently pursues his master’s murderer. The Duke of Austria sees to it that the dog and the marshal engage in a judicial ordeal whose outcome–the dog is victorious–exposes the marshal’s guilt. Ashamed and shocked by his error of judgement, the king bitterly regrets his actions and searches unsuccessfully for the queen for three and a half years. At last, a female merchant recognizes the queen’s exquisite needlework, which leads to the discovery of the queen and her three-year-old son, and the king and queen are reconciled.  In The Queen of France medieval honor emerges as a core concept at multiple points throughout the story: as a commodity that can be both acquired and lost, and as a matter of reputation and respect, which was the basis of the rule of elites. This translation makes The Queen of France available to scholars who are working on topics such as popular tales, on the prototypes of modern melodrama, or on depictions of animals in literature. \n Further Reading \n Jefferis, Sibylle. “Die Neuaufgefundene Heidelberger Handschrift von Schondochs ‘Königin von Frankreich und der Ungetreue Marschall’: Ihre Einordnung in die Übrige Handschriftenüberlieferung.” New Texts, Methodologies, and Interpretations in Medieval German Literature (Kalamazoo Papers 1992-1995), Kümmerle, 1999, pp. 209–27.

Notably it was intentionally preserved in a codex (manuscript book) of collected texts, including several Latin texts and German glosses. This is unusual: most extant Old High German texts were written in the margins and endpapers of manuscripts. Latin was preferred for church writing as the more prestigious and official language. The Wessobrunn Prayer is similar thematically and formally to the Old High German poem “Muspilli.” The codex has been dated to around 810 CE, and the prayer is written in Carolingian Miniscule (the standard script of the time). The prayer was named for the abbey at Wessobrunn in Bavaria where the codex resided for centuries before it was discovered and studied by philologists and eventually moved to the state library in Munich. The location where it was written and the identity of the author are unknown, though it was certainly someone with a knowledge of theology, perhaps a cleric or a monk. The prayer itself speculates about God and the universe before Creation, and emphasizes the power of the Holy Trinity and the nothingness before creation. There is a possible Anglo-Saxon influence: a star shaped rune is used for the common prefix “ga-,” and the format is similar to prayers used by Anglo-Saxon missionaries as they spread Christianity in Germany during the 8th century. Some of the language at the end of the prayer is parallel to the Nicene Creed, a declaration of faith standardized by the church in the 4th century. Scholars are interested in the Wessobrunn Prayer because of its unique poetic form. It is possible that there were many similar texts that did not survive. \n Credits \n Translation by Hannah Frakes, Edited by Björn Buschbeck, Encoded in TEI P5 XML by Hannah Frakes and Danny Smith \n"

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song depicts a romance between the speaker and a courtesan and the speaker's regret at their separation. Imagery of drunkenness is used in an innovative way: the line “Not knowing who had put me onto a horse” was originally composed by the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai 李白 as a reference to drunkenness that would express his carefree attitude; here, however, Yan Jidao uses the same line to express the opposite attitude: the desperation of his longing.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.    Yan Jidao 晏幾道 was the son of the eminent ci poet Yan Shu 晏殊. Together, Yan Jidao and Yan Shu are often referred to as “double Yan”, with Yan Jidao being the “Little Yan 小晏” and Yan Shu being the “Big Yan 大晏”, reflecting the fact that during their lifetimes they were both the iconic poets of the wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') subgenre of ci. Unlike his father, who held a prestigious state position alongside a blooming poetry career, Yan Jidao led a far more arduous life. As the seventh son of Yan Shu, he was born into a noble and wealthy family, and had little interest in officialdom at a young age. His lifestyle was extravagant, filled with luxurious banquets, joyous travels with friends, and beautiful courtesans.  After Yan Shu passed away in Yan Jidao's late teens, the young man realized the imminent financial difficulties which would befall him and abandoned his previously extravagant lifestyle, devoting himself to a political career. However, he struggled to replicate his father's success and was framed for his involvement in the movement against Wang Anshi’s New Policies (a series of government reforms), which led to him being jailed. Even though he was quickly released, this incident did huge damage to both his political career and his finances. In his later years, he returned to writing ci, and started compiling a collection of his own works, called Little Mountain Ci ( 小山词 ) . In the prologue to this collection, he wrote: “I now think of the ones who once drank with me. Some of them have passed away; others fell prey to illness. I read through my collection as if reliving my past sadnesses, joys, separations and gatherings, which now are like fantasies, or a sudden lighting strike, or a faded dream. Thus I could only cover my pages and mourn, for time slips away too fast, and past joys are illusory and unreal.”  As a poet of the wǎnyuē subgenre, Yan Jidao’s lyrics pay great attention to romantic affairs with courtesans. Compared to his contemporaries, Yan Jidao focuses more on the existential and emotional aspect rather than the physical aspect of these affairs, and incorporates more introspection into his poems. Because of the occurrence of specific names and locations in his ci, some of his ci invite a biographical reading. However, as ci are song lyrics intended for multiple performances by different singers on different occasions, there is also a universal character to the sentiments evoked in Yan Jidao’s ci which transcends the poet’s personal experiences. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

Yan Jidao uses a detailed description of the courtesan’s appearance to establish a melancholic tone, and the natural imagery of the changing leaves of the willow trees subtly suggests the passage of time. The willow tree is a common symbol of farewell and separation in Chinese poetry, since in ancient China there was a tradition of giving a willow branch to a person before their departure.

Yan Jidao 晏幾道 was the son of the eminent ci poet Yan Shu 晏殊. Together, Yan Jidao and Yan Shu are often referred to as “double Yan”, with Yan Jidao being the “Little Yan 小晏” and Yan Shu being the “Big Yan 大晏”, reflecting the fact that during their lifetimes they were both the iconic poets of the wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') subgenre of ci. Unlike his father, who held a prestigious state position alongside a blooming poetry career, Yan Jidao led a far more arduous life. As the seventh son of Yan Shu, he was born into a noble and wealthy family, and had little interest in officialdom at a young age. His lifestyle was extravagant, filled with luxurious banquets, joyous travels with friends, and beautiful courtesans.  After Yan Shu passed away in Yan Jidao's late teens, the young man realized the imminent financial difficulties which would befall him and abandoned his previously extravagant lifestyle, devoting himself to a political career. However, he struggled to replicate his father's success and was framed for his involvement in the movement against Wang Anshi’s New Policies (a series of government reforms), which led to him being jailed. Even though he was quickly released, this incident did huge damage to both his political career and his finances. In his later years, he returned to writing ci, and started compiling a collection of his own works, called Little Mountain Ci ( 小山词 ) . In the prologue to this collection, he wrote: “I now think of the ones who once drank with me. Some of them have passed away; others fell prey to illness. I read through my collection as if reliving my past sadnesses, joys, separations and gatherings, which now are like fantasies, or a sudden lighting strike, or a faded dream. Thus I could only cover my pages and mourn, for time slips away too fast, and past joys are illusory and unreal.”  As a poet of the wǎnyuē subgenre, Yan Jidao’s lyrics pay great attention to romantic affairs with courtesans. Compared to his contemporaries, Yan Jidao focuses more on the existential and emotional aspect rather than the physical aspect of these affairs, and incorporates more introspection into his poems. Because of the occurrence of specific names and locations in his ci, some of his ci invite a biographical reading. However, as ci are song lyrics intended for multiple performances by different singers on different occasions, there is also a universal character to the sentiments evoked in Yan Jidao’s ci which transcends the poet’s personal experiences. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n In this song, a farewell scene between a courtesan and her lover is depicted from the perspective of the courtesan. The lyrics convey both her sadness at his departure and her anger at the lack of commitment he has shown. Her complex emotions towards him reveal her deep love but also her powerlessness as a courtesan. An interesting image used here is the willow tree. This tree is a common symbol of farewell and separation in Chinese poetry, since in ancient China there was a tradition of giving a willow branch to a person about to depart. Another image worth mentioning is “cloud and rain” (雲雨), which is a euphemism for passionate sex, particularly within a relationship fated not to last. The expression comes from a writer, Song Yu 宋玉, who lived during the Warring States period (453–221 BCE). In his Song of Gao Tang ( 高唐赋 ), he narrates a brief love affair between the Huai King of Chu 楚怀王 and a mountain fairy which takes place in the king’s dream; in this dream, the mountain fairy describes her residence after their lovemaking as “made from the cloud in the morning, but comprised of rain in the evening”. “Cloud and rain” later became a common euphemism for sex in Chinese poetry.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives.

The happy scenes around him only induce greater homesickness, and he tries to drink his sorrow away. The Double Ninth Festival is the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, and during the Song Dynasty customs included holding banquets and making sacrifices to the ancestors. There was also the tradition of reuniting with family, going on trips and hiking. In modern China, the Double Ninth Festival honors the elderly, but it did not have that meaning when Yan Jidao was writing.

The poet creates an intimate scene through the careful depiction of details―the woman painting her eyebrows, writing songs, and compulsively rereading the letters from her lover while alone in her chamber.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n Like another ci in this collection, 'To the tune ‘Magnolia Flower’', this song was written about the courtesan Xiaolian, whom Yan Jidao knew personally. It evokes the speaker's regret at Xiaolian's departure. There is a notable use of natural imagery here to characterize the relationship between the speaker and the courtesan: their love is compared to the flowers and the moon. In ancient China, both blooming flowers and a full moon were metaphors for happiness and fulfilled goals, whereas wilting flowers and a waxing moon meant, respectively, loss and regret. The association between the blooming flowers and the full moon is captured in this Chinese idiom, 花好月圆. 花好月圆 is an adjectival phrase that can be used to describe a positive experience. Its original meaning is related to conjugal bliss. The first two lines of the second stanza, “Flowers wither easily; the moon waxes with difficulty”, therefore suggest the speaker’s pessimism about the future of his relationship with Xiaolian.

He writes a letter to her and recalls the sorrow of the day that they parted. The Ten Isles were traditionally conceived as the dwelling place of deities and magical creatures possessing powers unimaginable to humans.

An interesting image here is “the western building” (西樓). According to I Ching ( 周易 ), an ancient Chinese divination text, the direction west is associated with the element 'metal', which was considered to be the dominant element in autumn. Autumn is usually associated with separation and loneliness, so the image of the western building is often used by poets as a symbol for such feelings. I Ching also states that the direction west is feminine, 'yin' (阴). As a consequence, 'the western building' often refers to the private room of women in a household. The western building is a recurring image in ci poetry and appears in several of the texts in this collection.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold').

Yan Jidao 晏幾道 was the son of the eminent ci poet Yan Shu 晏殊. Together, Yan Jidao and Yan Shu are often referred to as “double Yan”, with Yan Jidao being the “Little Yan 小晏” and Yan Shu being the “Big Yan 大晏”, reflecting the fact that during their lifetimes they were both the iconic poets of the wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') subgenre of ci. Unlike his father, who held a prestigious state position alongside a blooming poetry career, Yan Jidao led a far more arduous life. As the seventh son of Yan Shu, he was born into a noble and wealthy family, and had little interest in officialdom at a young age. His lifestyle was extravagant, filled with luxurious banquets, joyous travels with friends, and beautiful courtesans.  After Yan Shu passed away in Yan Jidao's late teens, the young man realized the imminent financial difficulties which would befall him and abandoned his previously extravagant lifestyle, devoting himself to a political career. However, he struggled to replicate his father's success and was framed for his involvement in the movement against Wang Anshi’s New Policies (a series of government reforms), which led to him being jailed.

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song depicts the fear that one's love is not requited in equal measure. It is comparably more straightforward than other ci in this collection, with little to no use of natural imagery; instead, it centers on the direct expression of the speaker's agony.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work).

    "body": " Introduction to the Text \n This song evokes a relationship between the speaker and the courtesan Xiaoping (whom Yan Jidao knew personally). The first stanza portrays the speaker waking up late after a night of drinking. The dreary scenery (“locked doors”, “low curtains”) reinforces the sense of nostalgia for a lost happiness. The second stanza portrays his first meeting with Xiaoping. An important concept here is “the sorrow of spring” 春恨. The idea originates in the poignant brevity of springtime's beauty in nature, and thus is often deployed in ci poetry to express the sentiment that “all good things must come to an end”.

Other occasions for composing and enjoying ci would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many ci poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of ci : wǎnyuē (婉约, 'graceful') and háofàng (豪放, 'bold'). The wǎnyuē subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the háofàng subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.  Yan Shu, a powerful statesman in the early Northern Song court, had a long and successful career both as an official and as a poet. Among his many literary achievements (which include poetry, song lyrics and prose) his ci compositions are best known. His lyrics are elegant in their choice of words, controlled in the emotions they express, and not as playful as the ci of other well-known poets. They often capture feelings of solitude and sorrow, creating a melancholic mood, but the poet is rarely explicit about what triggers the worry or sadness. \n Further Reading \n Chang, Kang-i Sun.

    "body": " 浣溪沙 To the tune “Sands of the Washing Stream” 一曲新詞酒一杯。 A single new song, a single cup of wine 去年天氣舊亭臺。 On the old terrace in last year’s weather. 夕陽西下幾時回。 The setting sun has gone west, when will it return? 無可奈何花落去。 There’s no help for it, the blossoms fall and disappear; 似曾相識燕歸來。 I seem to recognize them, the swallows come back again. 小園香徑獨徘徊。 On the fragrant path of the little garden, I linger alone. \n Introduction to the Text \n This ci is regarded as Yan Shu’s masterpiece, because it conveys deep sentiments using few words. The first two lines of the second stanza are particularly admired for their parallelism and neat contrast. The song expresses feelings of sorrow and regret at the passage of spring. As in many of Yan Shu’s songs, there is no way to determine if the person being described is male or female. This is unusual and must be deliberate. It imparts to his songs a certain universality. The person before us could be anyone.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Ci is usually translated into English as 'song lyrics'. This is because ci were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of ci vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing ci would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment.

    "body": " 贈歌者 To a singer 家住西秦。 My family lived in the west of Qin, 賭博藝隨身。 I lived by my skills and talent in dancing and song; 花柳上、鬥尖新。 among all the blossoms and willows, 偶學念奴聲調， Occasionally I imitated the tunes of Niannu, 有時高遏行雲。 my voice could halt floating clouds in their path. 蜀錦纏頭無數， I have countless Shu brocades and silks, 不負辛勤。 my efforts were well-rewarded. 數年來往咸京道， For years now I have traveled between Xianyang and the capital. 殘杯冷炙謾消魂。 Leftover wine and cold food consume my spirit. 衷腸事、託何人。 To whom can I confide the things deep in my heart? 若有知音見採， If a patron who appreciated me would choose me, 不辭遍唱陽春。 I would willingly sing every one of the finest songs. 一曲當筵落淚， Now, a single song at the banquet and my tears start to fall. 重掩羅巾。 Once again, I hide my face with the silk kerchief. \n Introduction to the Text \n The subtitle of this ci suggests that it is supposed to be a gift for a particular singer, yet it also serves as a general depiction of a courtesan’s life during the Song Dynasty. One thing to be noted is the distinction between courtesans and singers. These two professions are often hard to discern in Song Dynasty ci. Even though they have similar names in Chinese, 妓 (ji) for courtesans and 歌姬 (ge ji) for singers, and their place of work is often similar, the singers’ work did not involve prostitution.  The two stanzas of this song are an example of antithesis. The first stanza is about how successful the singer was when she was younger, when she competed with the other “blossoms and willows” (i.e., courtesans) for men’s attention, and the second is about her troublesome and lonely life now that she is older and considered less desirable. This piece uses the example of one singer’s unfortunate fate to reflect on the lives of thousands of other singers: they were loved by affluent society when they were young, and cast aside when they were no longer valuable. At the same time, the song may have a secondary meaning as a reflection upon the poet’s own misfortune of not achieving the rank he wanted at the imperial court.  The ci genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

The first and final lines relate to the present, framing the old memories which make up the middle section of the song. This creates a contrast between the sorrowful and solitary present and the celebratory atmosphere when he first met his lover. The “flowers” mentioned in the closing lines have a double meaning: they are both flowering trees in the gardens where banquets were held and, even more, the female singers and dancers who entertained at those banquets, like the young woman the poet recalls in the first stanza.
