<h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>This story is one of five in the <i> Global Medieval Sourcebook </i> to have been selected from the <i> Yijian Zhi </i> (or, <i> Record of the Listener</i> , hereafter the <i> Record</i> ) by Hong Mai (1123-1202). Like many well-educated men in the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), Hong Mai grew up in a prominent family, passed the civil service examination, and obtained a post in the imperial government. However, due to misconduct during a diplomatic mission, his career came to an abrupt end. From then on, he retreated to his study and devoted himself to writing the <i> Record</i> .</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The corpus of the <i> Record </i> originally consisted of 420 chapters. What we have today, however, is but a small fraction of the original text. The <i> Record </i> shows a remarkable degree of accuracy when we compare it with the official documents and other texts of the same period. Nevertheless, many stories in the <i> Record </i> are outright fictitious or based on highly unreliable sources. The <i> Record </i> preserved much information about the society, culture, and religion of the Southern Song Dynasty and was a source of inspiration for generations of writers after Hong Mai. Writers in late imperial China, for instance, took up many stories in the <i> Record </i> and refashioned them into stories that met the demands and expectations of their own times.</p>

<p>There is a literatus from Tanzhou named Gong Yu. In the winter of the fourth year of the Dao Qian reign, he went with six or seven people from his hometown to participate in the provincial exam. When they passed Yi Chun, they paid their respects to the Yangshan Monastery and prayed for dreams. Gong Yu dreamt that he went into the government building and saw a piece of paper on the pillar of the building. On the paper were the four characters: “Gong Yu Bu De”<span> 1 </span> were written. But the upper part and the lower part of the character “Bu” were not connected. When Gong Yu woke up, he was quite unhappy and thought he would fail the exam. When the results came out in the spring, Gong Yu was selected and the rest of his group were rejected. Gong Yu began to tell people [what had happened], saying that the dream was not accurate. His acquaintances said: “When the character ‘Bu’ is disconnected like that, it should be read as two characters ‘Yi Ge.’ The deity was saying that only Gong Yu himself could do it, isn’t that obvious?”</p>
