<h1>Introduction to the Text</h1>
<p>This anonymous love song comes from a large songbook (called a ‘chansonnier’), most likely compiled for a wealthy client between 1460 and 1470 CE. Although this song has no named composer, many of the other 160 songs do, and they show that this book sought to capture the latest trends in French songwriting. This song is a rondeau written for three voices, who were to sing their different parts simultaneously. The lyrical content—sorrow at separation from a lover—is typical for a medieval love song, but this song is somewhat unusual in that it adopts a woman’s perspective.</p>

<p>Two or three days ago my sweet love went away</p>
<p>without saying anything to me. Alas, who will comfort me?</p>
<p>5 <span> I don’t know whether he wants to return</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>but he has made me very worried.</p>
<p>I will have to ask</p>
<p>those friends of his about it because, truly, I say to you</p>
<p>10 <span> that my heart never loved him better.</span></p>
