// Foundation 5 architecture requires @import due to circular dependencies between config files
// and the exports mixin pattern. These @import statements will generate deprecation warnings
// in Dart Sass 2.x but won't break until 3.0.0.
// To fully eliminate @import warnings would require upgrading to Foundation 6+ or refactoring
// the entire Foundation 5 codebase to use the @use module system.
