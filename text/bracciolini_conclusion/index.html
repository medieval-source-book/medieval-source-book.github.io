        <h2>Introduction to the Text</h2>
<p>Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and important humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe.</p>
<p>Through his texts we also meet a very polemical man, who seems to get into fights with many of his contemporaries, the most famous of which is his conflict with another of the humanist greats, Lorenzo Valla. The collections of jokes and stories known today as the <i> Facetiae</i>, but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as <i> Conversations </i> (<i> Confabulationes</i>), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his <i> Facetiae </i> are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The <i> Facetiae </i> as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the <i> Facetiae</i>, Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s <i> The Hermaphrodite</i>, which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punchline seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader).</p>
<p>In this conclusion to his <i> Facetiae, </i> Poggio reminisces about the context in which the <i> Facetiae </i> came to be<i>.</i></p>
<h2>Introduction to the Source</h2>
<p>The <i> Facetiae </i> seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The <i> Facetiae </i> was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or ‘conversations’ were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (to Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the <i> Facetiae </i> seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages.</p>
<h2>About this Edition</h2>
<p>The translation is based on the text as it appears in the Basel 1538 edition of Poggio’s collected work available on Google Books, with a slight update to punctuation and orthography (for instance, ij is represented as ii). No emendations or other corrections have been made by the translator. Older versions of the text contain a few variants and some obvious errors, but in general the tradition seems quite stable (see, for example, an early print from 1471; or the fifteenth-century manuscript in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Latin 8770A).</p>

<h2>Conclusion | Conclusio</h2>
<p>Conclusio</p>
<p>Visum est mihi eum quoque nostris confabulationibus locum adiicere, in quo plures earum, tanquam in scena, recitatae sunt. Is est ‘Bugiale’ nostrum, hoc est mendaciorum veluti officina quaedam, olim a secretariis institutum iocandi gratia. Consuevimus enim, Martini Pontificis usque tempore, quemdam eligere in secretiori aula locum, in quo et nova referebantur, et variis de rebus, tum laxandi ut plurimum animi causa, tum serio quandoque, colloquebamur. Ibi parcebatur nemini in lacessendo ea quae non probabantur a nobis, ab ipso persaepe Pontifice initium reprehensionis sumpto: quo fiebat ut plures eo convenirent, veriti ne ab eis ordiremur.</p>
<p>Erant in eo principes fabulator Razellus Bononiensis, cuius nonnulla in confabulationes coniecimus; Antonius item Luscus, qui saepius inseritur, vir admodum facetus; Cinciusque Romanus, et ipse iocis deditus. Nos quoque plura e nostris addidimus non insulsa. Hodie, cum illi diem suum obierint, desiit ‘Bugiale’, tum temporum, tum hominum culpa, omnisque iocandi confabulandique consuetudo sublata.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I think I should also introduce the place where many of my conversations were recited as though on a scene. This place is our “Bugiale,” which is like a type of workshop for liars and was once founded by secretaries for the sake of amusement. Ever since the time of Pope Martin (V) we used to choose a place in a remote chamber where news was reported, but we also used to talk about many different things, often to relax our spirits, but sometimes also serious matters. There no one would be spared when it came to criticising things we did not approve of, very often the pope himself would take the lead in this reproof. For this reason, it happened that many people gathered there for fear that we would start with them.</p>
<p>The leaders in this were the story-teller Razello di Bologna, some of whose stories I’ve thrown into this collection; and Antonio Loschi, a witty man who is often introduced in this work; and Cincio Romano, also a man fond of jokes. And I also added many of my own not too inelegant stories. Today, after they have left us, the “Bugiale” has ceased to be. Both time and men are to blame, and the entire custom to joke and converse has disappeared.</p>
